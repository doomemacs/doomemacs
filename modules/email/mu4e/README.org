* Description
This module makes Emacs an email client, using ~mu4e~.

#+begin_quote
I want to live in Emacs, but as we all know, living is incomplete without email.
So I prayed to the text editor gods and they (I) answered. Emacs+evil's editing
combined with org-mode for writing emails? /Yes please./

It uses ~mu4e~ to read my email, but depends on ~offlineimap~ (to sync my email
via IMAP) and ~mu~ (to index my mail into a format ~mu4e~ can understand).
#+end_quote

** Module Flags
+ ~+gmail~ Enables gmail-specific configuration.

** Plugins
This module install no plugins.

* Prerequisites
This module requires:

+ Either ~mbsync~ (default) or ~offlineimap~ (to sync mail with)
+ ~mu~, to index your downloaded messages and to provide the ~mu4e~ package.

** MacOS
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install mu
# And one of the following
brew install isync  # mbsync
brew install offlineimap
#+END_SRC

** Arch Linux
Run one of the following commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S isync  # mbsync
# OR
sudo pacman -S offlineimap
#+END_SRC

Install ~mu~, which is not available in the main repositories but in the AUR, by
using for example the AUR helper ~yay~.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yay -S mu
#+END_SRC

** NixOS
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    mu
    # And one of the following
    isync
    offlineimap
];
#+END_SRC

[[https://github.com/Emiller88/dotfiles/blob/5eaabedf1b141c80a8d32e1b496055231476f65e/modules/shell/mail.nix][An example of setting up mbsync and mu with home-manager]]

** openSUSE
Remove ~#~ in ~#sync_program=offlineimap~ to choose ~offlineimap~ instead of
~mbsync~.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo::
sync_program=isync # mbsync
#sync_program=offlineimap

sudo zypper install maildir-utils $sync_program
#+END_SRC

** Debian/Ubuntu
Run the command corresponding to the desired backend and the last one.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install isync  # mbsync
# or
sudo apt-get install offlineimap
# then
sudo apt-get install maildir-utils # mu
#+END_SRC
* TODO Features

* Configuration
** offlineimap
This module uses =mbsync= by default. To use =offlineimap=, change ~+mu4e-backend~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq +mu4e-backend 'offlineimap)
#+END_SRC

Next, you need to write a configuration file for =offlineimap=. Mine can be found
[[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles/tree/master/shell/mu][in my dotfiles repository]]. It is configured to download mail to ~\~/.mail~. I
use [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][unix pass]] to securely store my login credentials. You can find a *very*
detailed configuration [[https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap/blob/master/offlineimap.conf][here]].

Next you can download your email with ~offlineimap -o~. This may take a while,
especially if you have thousands of mails.

You can now proceed with the [[*mu and mu4e][mu and mu4e]] section.

** mbsync
The steps needed to set up =mu4e= with =mbsync= are very similar to the ones for
[[*offlineimap][offlineimap]].

Start with writing a ~\~/.mbsyncrc~. An example for GMAIL can be found on
[[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/migrating-from-offlineimap-to-mbsync-for-mu4e/][pragmaticemacs.com]]. A non-GMAIL example is available as a gist [[https://gist.github.com/agraul/60977cc497c3aec44e10591f94f49ef0][here]]. The [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][manual
page]] contains all needed information to set up your own.

Next you can download your email with ~mbsync --all~. This may take a while, but
should be quicker than =offlineimap= ;).

You can now proceed with the [[*mu and mu4e][mu and mu4e]] section.

** mu and mu4e
You should have your email downloaded already. If you have not, you need to set
=offlineimap= or =mbsync= up before you proceed.

Before you can use =mu4e= or the cli program =mu=, you need to index your email
initially. How to do that differs a little depending on the version of =mu= you
use. You can check your version with ~mu --version~.

For =mu= *>=1.4* you need to run two commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mu init --maildir ~/.mail --my-address email@example.com
mu index
#+END_SRC

=mu= *<1.4* only requires one command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mu index --maildir ~/.mail
#+END_SRC

Then configure Emacs to use your email address:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Each path is relative to `+mu4e-mu4e-mail-path', which is ~/.mail by default
(set-email-account! "Lissner.net"
  '((mu4e-sent-folder       . "/Lissner.net/Sent Mail")
    (mu4e-drafts-folder     . "/Lissner.net/Drafts")
    (mu4e-trash-folder      . "/Lissner.net/Trash")
    (mu4e-refile-folder     . "/Lissner.net/All Mail")
    (smtpmail-smtp-user     . "henrik@lissner.net")
    (user-mail-address      . "henrik@lissner.net")    ;; only needed for mu < 1.4
    (mu4e-compose-signature . "---\nHenrik Lissner"))
  t)
#+END_SRC

* Troubleshooting
** =No such file or directory, mu4e=
You will get =No such file or directory, mu4e= errors if you don't run ~doom
sync~ after installing =mu= through your package manager.
** ~(void-function org-time-add)~ error on Gentoo
Gentoo users will see this error because [[https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/net-mail/mu/files/70mu-gentoo.el#n2][the =net-mail/mu= package eagerly loads
=mu4e= (which pulls in =org=) much too early]]; before Emacs reads =~/.emacs.d=.
So early, that it loads the built-in version of org-mode, rather than the newer
version that Doom installs.

Later versions of the =net-mail/mu= package have [[https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/net-mail/mu?id=770e1fccb119fbce8ba6d16021a3598123f212ff][fixed this issue]], but you may
need to switch to the unstable build of =net-mail/mu= to see it.
