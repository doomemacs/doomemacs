+ Control applications as Emacs buffers.
+ Edit any application's input field with Emacs.
+ Use Emacs input methods in other applications.

** Hacks

When switching to a workspace where an EXWM buffer is focused, inputs do not get
passed to the application. To fix this, I wrote a hook which clicks on the
application with the mouse to regain focus. The spot I chose for clicking may
not be blank for all applications. If someone finds a better solution, please
submit a pull request.

* Prerequisites

This module has no prerequisites.

* Features

+ Edit any application's input field with ~C-c '~.
+ Use Emacs input methods in other applications. Simply set the input method as
  usual with =C-x RET C-\=.
+ Use Evil in any application! Specific browsers such as Google Chrome and
  Firefox have extended support for Evil keybindings. Simply install the
  ~link-hints~ extension/add-on and start VIM-ing!

Moreover, when this module is loaded, the following global keybindings are made:

| Keybinding | Description                  |
|------------+------------------------------|
| =SPC $=    | Open a GNU/Linux application |

* Configuration

** Setting up your ~xinitrc~ file.

In order to enable EXWM, Emacs needs to be running within X.Org without any
window manager present. The recommended way to go about this is with the
~startx~ script. The [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki/Configuration-Example][EXWM wiki]] contains an example ~xinitrc~ file for use by
~startx~.

** Setting the default major mode for EXWM Edit.
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2022-01-05 Wed 23:44]
:END:

By default, when you edit an application's input field and no programming
language can be detected in the text, ~org-mode~ will your major mode. If you
would like to change this, set the ~+exwm-edit-default-major-mode~ variable:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq +exwm-edit-default-major-mode 'markdown-mode)
#+end_src

** Setting up link hints for Chrome-based and Firefox-based web browsers
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2022-01-06 Thu 01:19]
:END:

For users of Evil, the ~f~ and ~F~ keys are bound to special Link Hint commands
within Chrome-based and Firefox-based web browsers. For these commands to work,
you must have the Link Hint add-on/extension installed. For Chrome-based web
browsers, install Link Hint through [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-hints/kjjgifdfplpegljdfnpmbjmkngdilmkd][here]]. For Firefox-based web browsers, use
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkhints/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search][this]] link instead.

** Setting up multiple monitors

Currently this module does not provide any simplified setup for multi-head
configurations. Please refer to
https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki#randr-multi-screen for how to do this.

** How do I send ~escape~ or ~C-c~ to applications?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2022-01-06 Thu 00:13]
:END:

| Keybind   | Description                                            |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-i= | Send the escape key (only bound when Evil is enabled). |
| =C-c C-c= | Send the C-c key.                                      |

** When I mouse-click while in Evil's normal state I get an error.
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2022-01-06 Thu 00:24]
:END:

I (the author) do not know how to suppress or remove the,
"evil-mouse-drag-region must be bound to an event with parameters" error. I
recommend ignoring this error though as your clicks still register.

This bug is a result of a workaround I copied from this GitHub issue:
https://github.com/walseb/exwm-firefox-evil/issues/1
