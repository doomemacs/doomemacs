* Description
What's an operating system without a terminal? The modules in this category
bring varying degrees of terminal emulation into Emacs.

If you can't decide which to choose, I recommend [[doom-package:][vterm]] or [[doom-package:][eshell]]. [[doom-module:][:term vterm]]
offers that best terminal emulation available but requires a few extra steps to
get going. [[doom-module:][:term eshell]] works everywhere that Emacs runs, even Windows, and
provides a shell entirely implemented in Emacs Lisp.
