#+title:    :term shell
#+subtitle: A REPL for your shell
#+created:  August 01, 2021
#+since:    21.12.0

* Description :unfold:
Provides a REPL for your shell.

#+begin_quote
 ðŸ’¡ =shell= is more REPL than terminal emulator. You can edit your command line
    like you would any ordinary text in Emacs -- something you can't do in [[doom-package:term]]
    (without ~term-line-mode~, which can be unstable) or [[doom-package:vterm]].

    Due to =shell='s simplicity, you're less likely to encounter edge cases
    (e.g. against your shell config), but it's also the least capable. TUI
    programs like =htop= or =vim= won't work in shell directly, but will be
    launched in a =term= buffer -- which handles them reasonably well.
