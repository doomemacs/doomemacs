#+title:    :term vterm
#+subtitle: As good as terminal emulation gets in Emacs
#+created:  January 16, 2019
#+since:    21.12.0 (#1144)

* Description :unfold:
This module provides a terminal emulator powered by libvterm. It is still in
alpha and requires a component be compiled (=vterm-module.so=).

#+begin_quote
 💡 [[doom-package:vterm]] is as good as terminal emulation gets in Emacs (at the
    time of writing) and the most performant, as it is implemented in C.
    However, it requires extra steps to set up.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

Prerequisites:
+ Emacs with dynamic module support (i.e. compiled with the =--with-modules=
  option),
+ =libvterm= (usually available through your OS package manager),
+ (if you want to compile =vterm-module.so= yourself) =make=, =cmake= and a C compiler
  such as =gcc=.

** Dynamic Module support
To check if your build of Emacs has dynamic module support, run ~$ doom info~ in
the shell and look for ~MODULES~ next to "features". If it isn't, you'll need to
find another source to install Emacs from or recompile it with the appropriate
build options.

Alternatively, look for ~--with-modules~ in ~system-configuration-options~ ([[kbd:][SPC h v
system-configuration-options]]).

Follow [[id:9570ba6a-50cc-4c46-a832-fb90192288af][our installation guide]] to ensure your build of Emacs includes dynamic
module support.

** libvterm
- Ubuntu or Debian users: ~$ apt-get install libvterm-dev~
- ArchLinux or Manjaro: ~$ pacman -S libvterm~
- MacOS: ~$ brew install libvterm~
- NixOS:
  #+begin_src nix
  systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # emacs    # no need for this, the next line includes emacs
    ((emacsPackagesFor emacs).emacsWithPackages (epkgs: [
      epkgs.vterm
    ]))
  ];
  #+end_src

  Or for home-manager users:
  #+begin_src nix
  programs.emacs = {
    enable = true;
    extraPackages = epkgs: [ epkgs.vterm ];
  };
  #+end_src

  This already contains a version of =vterm-module.so=, so NixOS users need not
  compile the module themselves as described below.

  Note: The =nixpkgs=-version used must be compatible with the packages Doom
  installs, so it might be necessary to pull in =emacs= and/or =emacsPackagesFor=
  from =unstable= or another channel. Otherwise arbitrary functionality of =vterm=
  might not work.
- Guix: ~$ guix install emacs-vterm~

  [[https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/emacs-vterm/][emacs-vterm]] provides a pre-built =vterm-module.so=, so you don't have to
  compile it yourself. It can also be installed through system or home packages.

** Compilation tools for vterm-module.so
When you first load vterm, it will attempt to compile =vterm-module.so= for you.
For this to succeed, you need the following:

- =make=
- =cmake=
- A C compiler like =gcc=
- An internet connection (=cmake= will download needed libraries)

There are several ways to manually install the module:

1. You can use ~M-x vterm-module-compile~ to let emacs automatically compile and
   install the module.

   Modify ~vterm-module-cmake-args~ to pass arguments to the cmake build script.
   e.g. To use a local build of libvterm instead of the included one:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq vterm-module-cmake-args "-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBVTERM=yes")
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
     Emacs will hang during the compilation. It may take a while.
   #+end_quote

2. You can compile and install the module yourself. Go to the vterm installation
   directory (usually =$HOME/.emacs.d/.local/packages/elpa/vterm-<version>=) and
   run the following:
   #+begin_src sh
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
   make
   #+end_src

3. You can also compile =vterm-module.so= elsewhere, but the module must be
   moved/symlinked to
   =$HOME/.emacs.d/.local/packages/elpa/vterm-<version>/vterm-module.so=
   =vterm-module.so=. Keep in mind that this folder will be deleted whenever the
   vterm package is updated.

* TODO Usage
#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The following commands are available to open it:

- ~+vterm/toggle~ ([[kbd:][<leader> o t]]) -- Toggle vterm pop up window in the current
  project.
- ~+vterm/here~ ([[kbd:][<leader> o T]]) -- Opens vterm in the current window.

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 This module has no configuration documentation yet. [[doom-contrib-module:][Write some?]]
#+end_quote

* Troubleshooting
[[doom-report:][Report an issue?]]

** Permission errors when compiling vterm on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
Emacs on Tumbleweed comes with =emacs-vterm=, which is deployed to a read-only
directory, but the vterm installation script depends on that directory being
writeable in order to compile. Uninstall =emacs-vterm= via zypper, then ~doom sync~
again and you should end up with a proper build of vterm.
