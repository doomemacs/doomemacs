#+title:    :term vterm
#+subtitle: As good as terminal emulation gets in Emacs
#+created:  January 16, 2019
#+since:    21.12.0 (#1144)

* Description :unfold:
This module provides a terminal emulator powered by libvterm. It is still in
alpha and requires a component be compiled (=vterm-module.so=).

#+begin_quote
 💡 [[doom-package:vterm]] is as good as terminal emulation gets in Emacs (at the time of
    writing) and the most performant, as it is implemented in C. However, it
    requires extra steps to set up:

    - Emacs must be built with dynamic modules support,
    - and =vterm-module.so= must be compiled, which depends on =libvterm=,
      =cmake=, and =libtool-bin=.

    [[doom-package:vterm]] will try to automatically build =vterm-module.so= when you first open
    it, but this will fail on Windows, NixOS and Guix out of the box. Install
    instructions for nix/guix can be found in the [[doom-module::term vterm]] module's
    documentation. There is no way to install vterm on Windows that I'm aware of
    (but perhaps with WSL?).

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

+ Emacs must be built with dynamic module support, i.e. compiled with the
  =--with-modules= option.
+ You need =libvterm= installed on your system.
+ You need =make=, =cmake= and a C compiler such as =gcc= so that vterm can
  build =vterm-module.so=.

** Dynamic Module support
To check if your build of Emacs was built with dynamic module support, check ~$
doom info~ for ~MODULES~ next to "System features". If it's there, you're good
to go.

You can also check for ~--with-modules~ in the ~system-configuration-options~
variable ([[kbd:][SPC h v system-configuration-options]]).

- Archlinux or Manjaro users who installed Emacs through pacman will have
  support baked in.
- MacOS users:
  - If you use [[https://emacsformacosx.com/][Emacs For Mac OS X]], this option is enabled.
  - If you use [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]], this option is enabled by default.
  - If you use [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][emacs-mac]], this options is *not* enabled by default. You may have
    to reinstall emacs with the option: ~$ brew install emacs-mac
    --with-modules~.

** libvterm
- Ubuntu or Debian users: ~$ apt-get install libvterm-dev~
- ArchLinux or Manjaro: ~$ pacman -S libvterm~
- MacOS: ~$ brew install libvterm~
- NixOS:

  #+begin_src nix
  systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # emacs    # no need for this, the next line includes emacs
    ((emacsPackagesFor emacs).emacsWithPackages (epkgs: [
      epkgs.vterm
    ]))
  ];
  #+end_src

  Or for home-manager users:
  #+begin_src nix
  programs.emacs = {
    enable = true;
    extraPackages = epkgs: [ epkgs.vterm ];
  };
  #+end_src
  
  This already contains a version of =vterm-module.so=, so NixOS users need not
  compile the module themselves as described below.
  
  Note: The =nixpkgs=-version used must be compatible with the packages Doom
  installs, so it might be necessary to pull in =emacs= and/or
  =emacsPackagesFor= from =unstable= or another channel. Otherwise arbitrary
  functionality of =vterm= might not work.

** Compilation tools for vterm-module.so
When you first load vterm, it will compile =vterm-module.so= for you. For this
to succeed, you need the following:

- =make=
- =cmake=
- A C compiler like =gcc=
- An internet connection (=cmake= will download needed libraries)

There are several ways to manually install the module:

1. You can use ~M-x vterm-module-compile~ to let emacs automatically compile and
   install the module.

   Modify ~vterm-module-cmake-args~ to pass arguments to the cmake build script.
   e.g. To use a local build of libvterm instead of the included one:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (setq vterm-module-cmake-args "-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBVTERM=yes")
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
     Emacs will hang during the compilation. It may take a while.
   #+end_quote

2. You can compile and install the module yourself. Go to the vterm installation
   directory (usually =$HOME/.emacs.d/.local/packages/elpa/vterm-<version>=) and
   run the following:
   #+begin_src sh
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
   make
   #+end_src

3. You can also compile =vterm-module.so= elsewhere, but the module must be
   moved/symlinked to
   =$HOME/.emacs.d/.local/packages/elpa/vterm-<version>/vterm-module.so=
   =vterm-module.so=. Keep in mind that this folder will be deleted whenever the
   vterm package is updated.

The following commands are available to open it:

- ~+vterm/toggle~ ([[kbd:][<leader> o t]]) -- Toggle vterm pop up window in the current
  project.
- ~+vterm/here~ ([[kbd:][<leader> o T]]) -- Opens vterm in the current window.

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 This module has no configuration documentation yet. [[doom-contrib-module:][Write some?]]

* Troubleshooting
[[doom-report:][Report an issue?]]

** Permission errors when compiling vterm on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
Emacs on Tumbleweed comes with =emacs-vterm=, which is deployed to a read-only
directory, but the vterm installations cript depends on that directory being
writeable in order to compile. You'll need to uninstall =emacs-vterm= via
zypper, then ~doom sync~ again and you should end up with a proper build of
vterm.
