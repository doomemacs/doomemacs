(defvar evil-collection-key-blacklist)

;; We load evil-collection ourselves for these reasons:
;;
;; 1. To truly lazy load it. Some of its modules, like
;;    evil-collection-{elisp-mode,buff-menu} are loaded immediately, because
;;    Emacs loads their packages immediately, which pulls in all of
;;    evil-collection (and other packages with it, sometimes).
;; 2. This ensures a predictable load order, versus lazy loading using :defer or
;;    :after-call. This means users can use (after! org ...) and be sure that
;;    their changes will override evil-collection's.
;; 3. Ideally, we'd do away with evil-collection entirely. It changes too often,
;;    introduces breaking bugs too frequently, and I don't agree with all their
;;    design choices. Regardless, it does more good than trouble, so it may be
;;    here to stay.
;; 4. Adds `+evil-collection-disabled-list', to make it easier for users to
;;    disable modules, and to reduce the effort required to maintain our copy of
;;    `evil-collection-list' (now I can just copy it from time to time).
