* Description :unfold:

~protected~, and ~private~ (in ~c++-mode~).

/This module has no external requirements./

* TODO Usage
#+begin_quote
ðŸ”¨ /This module's usage documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

For evil users: [[kbd:][[r]] and [[kbd:][]r]] will cycle back and forward (respectively) through
specified patterns for the text at point. Patterns will wrap around as you cycle
through them.

* TODO Configuration

To enable a set of items to cycle through globally:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(after! rotate-text
  (add-to-list 'rotate-text-words '("small" "medium" "large")))
#+end_src

To add a sequence to a specific mode:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(set-rotate-patterns! 'c++-mode
    :words '(("float" "double")))
#+end_src

When configuring a sequence of words or symbols that should be rotated through,
it is important that all items are all lower case. The casing will be determined
by the item that initiated the rotation. For example, ~Small~ will be replaced
with ~Medium~ and ~SMALL~ will be replaced with ~MEDIUM~ using the example
described above.
