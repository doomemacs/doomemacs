** Hacks
# A list of internal modifications to included packages; omit if unneeded

* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features
# An in-depth list of features, how to use them, and their dependencies.
** Multiple-cursors
*** The evil-mc keys are under the =gz= prefix
**** =gzz= to toggle new (frozen) cursors at point
**** =gzt= to toggle mirroring on and off (or switch to insert mode to activate them)
**** =gzA= to place cursors at the end of each selected line
**** =gzI= will place them at the beginning
*** There's also the ex command `:mc/REGEXP/FLAGS`, for laying down cursors by regex
** Multi-edit
Designates "interactive edit" regions. Only the textual changes to them are mirrored.

*** =M-d= to iedit the symbol at point. Again to iedit its next match.
*** =M-S-d= to do it backwards
*** =R= (in visual mode) to iedit all matches of the selection at point in the buffer
*** Or `:iedit/REGEX` to iedit all matches of REGEX
