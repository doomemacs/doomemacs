| Keybind                | Description               |
|------------------------+---------------------------|
| =C-c C-f C-f=          | Fold region               |
| =C-c C-f C-u= or =C `= | Unfold region             |
| =C-c C-f C-d=          | Delete folded region      |
| =C-c C-a C-f=          | Refold all regions        |
| =C-c C-a C-u=          | Unfold all regions        |
| =C-c C-a C-d=          | Delete all folded regions |

* TODO Configuration

* Troubleshooting
Sometimes an unfolded region does not fold back with =C-c C-f C-f=. To bypass this bug you must delete the folded region (=C-c C-f C-d=) and then fold it(=C-c C-f C-f=) again.
