#+TITLE: :editor lispy

This modules adds [[https://github.com/noctuid/lispyville][lispy]] key functionality in Lisp languages.

This includes:

- Common Lisp
- Emacs Lisp
- Scheme
- Racket
- [[http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/][Hy]]
- [[http://lfe.io/][LFE]]
- Clojure

If evil is enabled, lispyville would also be activated for every mode where
lispy is active

The default key themes that are set are as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(lispyville-set-key-theme
 '((operators normal)
    c-w
    (prettify insert)
    (atom-movement normal visual)
    slurp/barf-lispy
    (wrap normal insert)
    additional
    additional-insert
    (additional-wrap normal insert)
    (escape insert)))
#+END_SRC

See noctuid's [[https://github.com/noctuid/lispyville/blob/master/README.org][README]] for more info on specific keybindings (starting [[https://github.com/noctuid/lispyville#operators-key-theme][here]]) of
each key theme. Think of ~lispyville-set-key-theme~ as adding
~parinfer-extensions~ via ~(setq parinfer-extensions '(blah blah blah))~.
