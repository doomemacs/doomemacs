* Description
This module adds a minor-mode ~+word-wrap-mode~, which intelligently wraps long
lines in the buffer without modifying the buffer content.

Wrapped lines will be indented to match the preceding line. In code buffers,
lines which are not inside a string or comment will have extra indentation as
determined by ~+word-wrap-extra-indent~. The default is to increase the indent
by twice the major-mode indent.

The ~+word-wrap-extra-indent~ variable supports the following values:
- ~double~: indent by twice the major-mode indentation
- ~single~: indent by the major-mode indentation
- a positive integer: indent by this fixed amount
- a negative integer: dedent by this fixed amount
- ~nil~: no extra indent

Long lines are wrapped at the window margin by default, however soft-wrapping at
~fill-column~ is supported by setting ~+word-wrap-fill-style~. When set to
~auto~, if ~auto-fill-mode~ is enabled in the buffer, its behaviour will not be
affected. This allows hard and soft wrapping methods to co-exist, with
hard-wrapping for new lines and soft-wrapping for existing lines. To disable
hard-wrapping entirely, set ~+word-wrap-fill-style~ to ~soft~.

This module also includes a global minor-mode ~+global-word-wrap-mode~ to
automatically enable wrapping in most buffers. Wrapping will not be enabled in
buffers whose major mode is marked "special", or are listed in
~+word-wrap-disabled-modes~.

The ~+word-wrap-text-modes~ variable lists modes which shouldn't have any extra
indentation, regardless of the ~+word-wrap-extra-indent~ setting. This is useful
for modes which are primarily text, such as ~text-mode~ and ~markdown-mode~.

The ~+word-wrap-visual-modes~ variable lists modes which should only enable
~visual-line-mode~ and not provide any prefix indentation. This is useful for
modes like ~org-mode~ which handle prefix indentation themselves.

* Configuration
Word wrapping is not enabled by default.

Wrapping can be toggled in the current buffer with ~M-x +word-wrap-mode~. The
default doom bindings bind this to ~SPC t w~ for ~evil~ users.

To enable wrapping in a specific mode, add it to the appropriate hook in your
~config.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; enable word-wrap in C/C++/ObjC/Java
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook #'+word-wrap-mode)
#+END_SRC

To customize the behaviour in a specific mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; use a single indent and wrap at fill-column in json-mode
(add-hook! 'json-mode-hook
  (setq-local +word-wrap-extra-indent 'single)
  (setq-local +word-wrap-fill-style 'soft)
  (+word-wrap-mode +1))
#+END_SRC

To turn on word wrapping (almost) everywhere:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; enable word-wrap (almost) everywhere
(+global-word-wrap-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

To disable global word-wrapping in a specific mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; disable global word-wrap in emacs-lisp-mode
(add-to-list '+word-wrap-disabled-modes 'emacs-lisp-mode)
#+END_SRC
