* Description

Parinfer is a minor mode that aids the writing of Lisp code. It automatically
infers parenthesis matching and indentation alignment, keeping your code
balanced and beautiful.

Note that the original =parinfer-mode= has been deprecated and superceded by
=parinfer-rust-mode=, which has much better performance.
