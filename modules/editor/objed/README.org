#+TITLE: :editor objed

This modules adds [[https://github.com/clemera/objed][objed]], a global minor-mode for navigating and manipulating
text objects. It combines the ideas of versor-mode and other editors like Vim or
Kakoune and tries to align them with regular Emacs conventions.

Note that `objed` is intended as an *alternative* to the `evil` module, for
people who prefer standard Emacs key-bindings and conventions. It's not
recommended to use these modules together.

See the project [[https://github.com/clemera/objed][README]] for information on keybinds and usage.
