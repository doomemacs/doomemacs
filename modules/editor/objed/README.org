This modules adds [[https://github.com/clemera/objed][objed]], a global minor-mode for navigating and manipulating
text objects. It combines the ideas of versor-mode and other editors like Vim or
Kakoune and tries to align them with regular Emacs conventions.

Note that =objed= is intended as an *alternative* to =evil=, for people who
prefer standard Emacs key-bindings and conventions. It's not recommended to use
these modules together.

[[https://github.com/clemera/objed][See the objed project README]] for information on keybinds and usage.
