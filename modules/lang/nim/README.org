* Description :unfold:
This module adds [[https://nim-lang.org][Nim]] support to Doom Emacs.

- Code completion ([[doom-package:nimsuggest]] + [[doom-package:company]])
- Syntax checking ([[doom-package:nimsuggest]] + [[doom-package:flycheck]])
- Org babel support ([[doom-package:ob-nim]])

** Maintainers
*This module needs a maintainer.* [[doom-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
/This module has no flags./

** Packages
- [[doom-package:flycheck-nim]] if [[doom-module::checkers syntax]]
- [[doom-package:nim-mode]]

** Hacks
- [[doom-package:nimsuggest]] was modified to strip invalid characters from its temp file paths
  (which would break nimsuggest on Windows systems).
- [[doom-package:nim-mode]] was modified to fail gracefully if =nimsuggest= (the executable)
  isn't available.
