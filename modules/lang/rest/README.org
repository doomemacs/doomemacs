* Description
This module adds [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer][REST]] support.

+ Code-completion (~company-restclient~)
+ Code evaluation
+ Imenu support for ~restclient-mode~
+ org-mode: babel support (~ob-restclient~)

#+begin_quote
~restclient-mode~ is tremendously useful for automated or quick testing REST
APIs. My workflow is to open an ~org-mode~ buffer, create a restclient source
block and hack away. ~restclient-mode~ and ~company-restclient~ power this
arcane wizardry.
