* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module requires that the =graphviz= package be installed on your system to
build diagrams with. You can install it using:
#+begin_src shell
sudo dnf install graphviz # For fedora
sudo apt install graphviz # For debian/ubuntu
#+end_src

* Usage
This module should configure "out-of-the-box" if you have installed graphviz on
your system.

With org-babel LaTeX/PDF-export, use a file naming ending with ".pdf", otherwise
LaTeX might complain about a non-existant ~\\includesvg~ command.
#+begin_src dot :file graph-1.pdf
digraph {
        A -> B;
        B -> D;
}
#+end_src

* Configuration
There is nothing to configure. Just install dot and it should work.
