* Description
This module adds org-mode support to Doom Emacs, along with a number of
adjustments, extensions and reasonable defaults to make it more performant and
intuitive out of the box:

+ A custom, centralized attachment system that stores files in one place, rather
  than in the same directory as the input file(s) (only applies to attachments
  from files in/under =org-directory=).
+ Executable code blocks with support for a variety of languages and tools
  (depending on what :lang modules are enabled).
+ Supports an external org-capture workflow through the =bin/org-capture= shell
  script and ~+org-capture/open-frame~.
+ A configuration for using org-mode for slide-show presentations or exporting
  org files to reveal.js slideshows.
+ Drag-and-drop support for images (with inline preview) and media files (drops
  a file icon and a short link) (requires =+dragndrop= flag).
+ Integration with pandoc, ipython, jupyter, reveal.js, beamer, and others
  (requires flags).
+ Export-to-clipboard functionality, for copying text into formatted html,
  markdown or rich text to the clipboard (see ~+org/export-to-clipboard~ and
  ~+org/export-to-clipboard-as-rich-text~).

#+begin_quote
Org is a system for writing plain text notes with syntax highlighting, code
execution, task scheduling, agenda management, and many more. The whole idea is
that you can write notes and mix them with references to things like articles,
images, and example code combined with the output of that code after it is
executed.

** Module Flags
+ =+brain= Enables [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]] integration.
+ =+dragndrop= Enables drag-and-drop support for images and files; inserts
  inline previews for images and an icon+link for other media types.
+ =+gnuplot= Installs gnuplot & gnuplot-mode, which enables rendering images
  from gnuplot src blocks or plotting tables with ~org-plot/gnuplot~ (bound to
  =SPC m b p=, by default).
+ =+hugo= Enables integration with [[https://gohugo.io][hugo]] to export from Emacs well-formed
  ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][blackfriday]]) markdown.
+ =+ipython= (**DEPRECATED**) Enables ipython integration for babel.
+ =+journal= Enables [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][org-journal]] integration.
+ =+jupyter= Enables Jupyter integration for babel.
+ =+noter= Enables org-noter integration. Keeps notes in sync with a document.
  Requires [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] (=:tools pdf=) or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Document-View.html][DocView]] or [[https://github.com/wasamasa/nov.el][nov.el]] to be enabled.
+ =+pandoc= Enables pandoc integration into the Org exporter.
+ =+pomodoro= Enables a pomodoro timer for clocking time on tasks.
+ =+present= Enables integration with reveal.js, beamer and org-tree-slide, so
  Emacs can be used for presentations. It automatically downloads [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js][reveal.js]].
+ =+pretty= Enables pretty unicode symbols for bullets and priorities, and
  better syntax highlighting for latex. Keep in mind: this can be expensive. If
  org becomes too slow, it'd be wise to disable this flag.
+ =+roam= Enables org-roam integration. This requires ~sqlite3~ to be installed
  on your system.

** Hacks
+ The window is recentered when following links.
+ The breadcrumbs displayed in eldoc when hovering over an org headline has been
  reworked to strip out link syntax and normalize font-size disparities.
+ If =:ui workspaces= is enabled, persp-mode won't register org agenda buffers that
  are temporarily opened in the background.
+ Temporary org agenda files aren't added to recentf.
+ =file:= links are highlighted with the ~error~ face if they are broken.
+ TAB was changed to toggle only the visibility state of the current subtree,
  rather than cycle through it recursively. This can be reversed with:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (after! evil-org
    (remove-hook 'org-tab-first-hook #'+org-cycle-only-current-subtree-h))
  #+END_SRC
+ (Evil users) Nearby tables are formatted when exiting insert or replace mode
  (see ~+org-enable-auto-reformat-tables-h~).
+ Statistics cookies are updated when saving the buffer of exiting insert mode
  (see ~+org-enable-auto-update-cookies-h~).
+ Org-protocol has been lazy loaded (see ~+org-init-protocol-lazy-loader-h~);
  loaded when the server receives a request for an org-protocol:// url.
+ Babel and babel plugins are now lazy loaded (see
  ~+org-init-babel-lazy-loader-h~); loaded when a src block is executed. No need
  to use ~org-babel-do-load-languages~ in your config, just install your babel
  packages to extend language support (and ensure its ~org-babel-execute:*~
  function is autoloaded).
+ If a variable is used as a file path in ~org-capture-template~, it will be
  resolved relative to ~org-directory~, instead of ~default-directory~ (see
  ~+org-capture-expand-variable-file-a~).

* Prerequisites
Org has a few soft dependencies that you will need to make use of Org's more
esoteric features:

+ For inline LaTeX previews, ~latex~ and ~dvipng~ is needed.
+ To render GNUPlot images (with =+gnuplot= flag) the ~gnuplot~ program is
  needed.
+ To execute babel code blocks, you need whatever dependencies those languages
  need. It is recommended you enable the associated =:lang= module and ensure
  its dependencies are met, e.g. install the =ruby= executable for ruby support.
+ =org-roam= (with the =+roam= flag) requires =sqlite3= to be installed.

** MacOS
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew cask install mactex
brew install gnuplot
#+END_SRC

** Arch Linux
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S texlive-core texlive-bin texlive-science
pacman -S gnuplot
#+END_SRC

** NixOS
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # any less than medium isn't guaranteed to work
  texlive.combined.scheme-medium
];
#+END_SRC

** TODO Windows

* Features
** Invoking the org-capture frame from outside Emacs
The simplest way to use the org-capture frame is through the ~bin/org-capture~
script. I'd recommend binding a shortcut key to it. If Emacs isn't running, it
will spawn a temporary daemon for you.

Alternatively, you can call ~+org-capture/open-frame~ directly, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacsclient --eval '(+org-capture/open-frame INTIAL-INPUT KEY)'
#+END_SRC

** Built-in custom link types
This module defines a number of custom link types in ~+org-init-custom-links-h~.
They are (with examples):

+ ~doom-docs:news/2.1.0~ (=~/.emacs.d/docs/%s=)
+ ~doom-modules:editor/evil/README.org~ (=~/.emacs.d/modules/%s=)
+ ~doom-repo:issues~ (=https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/%s=)
+ ~doom:core/core.el~ (=~/.emacs.d/%s=)
+ ~duckduckgo:search terms~
+ ~gimages:search terms~ (Google Images)
+ ~github:hlissner/doom-emacs~
+ ~gmap:Toronto, Ontario~ (Google Maps)
+ ~google:search terms~
+ ~org:todo.org~ (={org-directory}/%s=)
+ ~wolfram:sin(x^3)~
+ ~wikipedia:Emacs~
+ ~youtube:P196hEuA_Xc~ (link only)
+ ~yt:P196hEuA_Xc~ (like =youtube=, but includes an inline preview of the video)

* Configuration
** Changing ~org-directory~
To modify ~org-directory~ it must be set /before/ =org= has loaded:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq org-directory "~/new/org/location/")
#+END_SRC
** Changing ~org-noter-notes-search-path~
To modify ~org-noter-notes-search-path~ set:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq org-noter-notes-search-path '("~/notes/path/"))
#+END_SRC
