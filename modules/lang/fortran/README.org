* Description :unfold:
This module enables a complete, modern development environment for the [[https://fortran-lang.org/][Fortran]]
language. Initially released in 1956 (a year before Lisp 1.0), Fortran is the
original high-performance computation language and is still widely used in
science and academia. Popular versions of the language include Fortran 77 and
Fortran 90, with further extensions in the 1995 and 2008 varieties. Today,
Fortran has joined the modern age with its own [[https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm][package manager]], [[https://fortran-lang.org/packages/][package registry]]
and [[https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/][Discourse community]].

In particular, this module features:
- Support for all major Fortran varieties.
- Auto-formatting via =fprettier=.
- Integration with the =fpm= package manager.
- LSP support via [[https://github.com/gnikit/fortls][fortls]].
- Optional Intel Fortran support via the [[doom-module:+intel]] flag.

#+begin_quote
 󰟶 After a career of writing Fortran on Mainframes and Windows machines, my
    now-retired Dad is switching to Linux. Imagine my surprise when I learned
    that off-the-shelf setups for Fortran on Linux basically don't exist! Well,
    until now... Cheers Dad, hope this helps. --[[doom-user:][fosskers]]

** Module flags
- +lsp ::
  Enable LSP support for ~fortran-mode~. Requires [[doom-module::tools lsp]] and a langserver
  (fortls).
- +intel ::
  Use the =ifort= compiler by default.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

** General
For minimum functionality, this module requires =gfortran=. For most project
management tasks you will also need [[https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm][fpm]], the Fortran Package Manager.

*** Arch Linux
=gfortran= is available from the official repositories:
#+begin_src bash
$ sudo pacman -S gcc-fortran
#+end_src bash

Whereas =fpm= and =fortls= are available from the AUR and thus must be installed
with an AUR-compatible tool like [[https://github.com/fosskers/aura][Aura]]:
#+begin_src bash
$ sudo aura -A fortran-fpm fortls
#+end_src bash

** Installing Intel Fortran
Activating the [[doom-module:+intel]] flag won't automatically install Intel Fortan for you.
Here's how to do it on *nix systems.

You can of course install the entire High-performance Computing kit from Intel,
which includes Fortran, but the installation footprint is quite large. Instead,
you're able to install just Fortran and its core facilities on their own as a
[[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html#fortran][standalone component]]. Download this script, and make it executable via:
#+begin_src bash
$ chmod +x l_fortran-compiler_p_2022.0.3.83_offline.sh
#+end_src bash

The filepath will of course change with time, so alter the above command
accordingly. Now run the script _as a normal user_ (non-sudo) and follow the
instructions of the installer. This will install =ifort=, etc., in a local
filepath of your choosing.

To actually use =ifort= and have it link to its libraries properly, we must run
a script provided by Intel to set certain environment variables:
#+begin_src bash
$ . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
#+end_src

(Modify according to where you installed Intel Fortran.) Now =ifort= should be
runnable in your terminal as you'd expect. _To persist this, add that line to
your Bash Profile, etc., and log out and in again._ Now Doom will be able to use
=ifort= too.

Good luck and happy computing!

** Auto-formatting
When [[doom-module::editor format]] is enabled and [[doom-executable:fprettify]] is installed, buffers can be formatted with [[fn:apheleia-format-buffer]].

Enable [[doom-module::editor format +onsave]] to format the buffer on save.

See below for advanced configuration.

** Customising fprettier

If you want different arguments to be passed to =fprettier=, follow this example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'f90
  (set-formatter! 'fprettify '("fprettify" "--enable-decl" "-w" "4" "-") :modes '(f90-mode fortran-mode)))
#+end_src
