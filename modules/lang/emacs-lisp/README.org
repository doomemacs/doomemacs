** Hacks
+ Symbols that are defined in the current session are highlighted with
  ~font-lock-variable-face~.
+ Eldoc will display the values of variables next to its documentation.
+ ~elisp-demos~ was modified to display API demos for Doom's standard library
  (in [[file:../../../docs/api.org][docs/api.org]]).
+ This module extends imenu support for Doom's API (e.g. ~package!~,
  ~use-package~, ~after!~)
+ Flycheck has been configured to tone down the false positives when you are
  editing your Emacs or Doom config.
