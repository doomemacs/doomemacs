* Description
Provide a helping hand when working with LaTeX documents.

+ Sane defaults
+ Fontification of many popular commands
+ Pretty indentation of wrapped lines using the ~adaptive-wrap~ package
+ Spell checking with ~flycheck~
+ Change PDF viewer to Okular or ~latex-preview-pane~
+ Bibtex editor
+ Autocompletion using ~company-mode~
+ Compile your .tex code only once using LatexMk

** Module Flags
+ =+latexmk= Use LatexMk instead of LaTeX to compile documents.
+ =+cdlatex= Enable [[https://github.com/cdominik/cdlatex][cdlatex]] for fast math insertion.
+ =+lsp= Start LSP automatically in `tex-mode-hook`. This requires the =:tools
  lsp= module. Supported servers are `digestif` and `TexLab`.
+ =+fold= Use TeX-fold (from auctex) to fold LaTeX macros to unicode, and make
  folding hook-based and less manual.

** Plugins

* Prerequisites
You will need ghostscript and a latex compiler. All this is provided by
the =texlive= bundle, available through many OS package managers.

Ghostscript <= 9.27 is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/preview-latex/No-images-are-displayed-with-gs-9_002e27-and-earlier.html][reported buggy]] and doesn't work with auctex's math
previews. (You can check you ghostscript version with ~gs --version~.) Most
package managers already have newer versions, but if not you might have to build
gs from source.
** Ubuntu
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
apt-get install texlive
#+END_SRC

** Arch Linux
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pacman -S texlive-core
#+END_SRC

** TODO macOS
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew cask install basictex
# If the above doesn't work, then
brew cask install mactex  # WARNING: large 4gb download!
#+END_SRC

#+begin_quote
This has not been verified.
#+end_quote

** NixOS
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-medium ];
#+END_SRC

* TODO Features

* Customization
** Specifying the location of a bibtex file & corresponding PDFs
Reftex has a variable that allow you to
specify where it should find your bibliography file(s):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq reftex-default-bibliography "/your/bib/file.bib")
#+END_SRC

** Changing the PDFs viewer
This module provides integration for four supported pdf viewers. They are

+ [[https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/][Skim.app]] (MacOS only)
+ Evince
+ Sumatra PDF
+ Zathura
+ Okular
+ pdf-tools (requires =:tools pdf= module)

They are searched for in this order. See ~+latex-viewers~ to change the order,
or remove tools from the search altogether. If you want to exclusively use one
tool, for instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq +latex-viewers '(zathura))
#+END_SRC

If none of these tools are found, ~latex-preview-pane~ (uses ~DocView~ in Emacs)
is used as a fallback. You can use this exclusively by setting ~+latex-viewers~
to ~nil~.

** Using cdlatex's snippets despite having yasnippet
cdlatex has a snippet insertion capability which is disabled in favor of
yasnippet when using ~:editor snippets~. If you still wanna use it, simply rebind
the ~TAB~ key for cdlatex, which takes care of snippet-related stuff:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map! :map cdlatex-mode-map
    :i "TAB" #'cdlatex-tab)
#+END_SRC

This would favor yasnippet's expansion and cursor movement over cdlatex's
expansion and movement, but that shouldn't matter if you're not using yasnippet
in latex buffers.
