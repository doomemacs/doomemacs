#+begin_quote
PHP was the first programming language I got paid to code in, back in the Cretaceous period (2003). My sincerest apologies go out to all the programmers who inherited my earliest PHP work. I know you're out there, writhing in your straitjackets.

Save a programmer today. Stop a friend from choosing PHP as their first language.

* Install
** PHP
To get started with PHP, you'll need ~php~ (5.3+) and ~composer~:

*** MacOS
PHP 5.5 comes prepackaged with newer versions of MacOS. These instructions are provided for reference:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle (if (doom-system-os 'macos) "yes")
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
brew install php71  # or php53, php54, php55
brew install composer
#+END_SRC

*** Arch Linux
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo:: :tangle (if (doom-system-os 'arch) "yes")
sudo pacman --needed --noconfirm -S php composer  # or php53, php54, php55
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies
The features in this module optionally depend on the following php packages:

+ ~boris~ (REPL)
+ ~phpctags~ (better code completion)
+ ~phpunit~ (unit test commands)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
composer global require \
    d11wtq/boris \
    phpunit/phpunit \
    techlivezheng/phpctags
#+END_SRC

Ensure that ~\~/.composer/vendor/bin~ is in ~PATH~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# place this in your profile file, like ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshenv
export PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
#+END_SRC
