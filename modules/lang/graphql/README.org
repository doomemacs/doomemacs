- +lsp ::
  Enable LSP support for ~graphql-mode~. Requires [[doom-module::tools lsp]] and a langserver
  ([[https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphql-language-service-cli#readme][graphql-language-service-cli]]).

** Packages
- [[doom-package:company-graphql]] unless [[doom-module:+lsp]]
- [[doom-package:graphql-mode]]
- [[doom-package:graphql-doc]]

** Hacks

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module has no direct requirements, but the +lsp flag requires a [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-graphql/][supported
LSP server]].

* Usage
** Sending queries
When visiting a graphql buffer, you have access to the ability to send the
current query with =C-c C-c= which will prompt you for an optional variables file,
then execute the query and return a buffer of the results.

It's also possible to send queries using org-babel using a block such as the
ones below (executing correctly will require =:lang org=)

#+NAME: my-variables
#+begin_src json
{
    "continentCode": "AF"
}
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_SRC graphql :url https://countries.trevorblades.com/ :variables my-variables
query GetContinents($continentCode: String!) {
  continent(code: $continentCode) {
    name
    code
  }
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {
:   "data": {
:     "continent": {
:       "name": "Africa",
:       "code": "AF"
:     }
:   }
: }

** Viewing docs
With this module, there are 3 ways to view schemas:
+ =+graphql-doc-open-config= which uses a local [[https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/graphql-config-examples][=.graphqlconfig=]] file to seed endpoints to query
+ =graphql-doc= which prompts you to select an endpoint based on ones added manually by =graphql-doc-add-api=
+ =graphql-doc-open-url= which prompts to to manually enter an endpoint url

When using the doc viewer, there are a few bindings for navigating around.

| Key         | Command             | Description                       |
|-------------+---------------------+-----------------------------------|
| =C-j=         | =forward-button=      | Follow a forward button           |
| =C-k=         | =backward-button=     | Follow a backward button          |
| =<backspace>= | =graphql-doc-go-back= | Go back to a previous page        |
| =mouse-1=     | -                   | Follow the next label under =point= |
| =RET=         | -                   | Follow the next label under =point= |

* Configuration
Most of the "magic" in the module relies on a properly configured [[https://github.com/jimkyndemeyer/graphql-config-examples][.graphqlconfig]]
file, so follow the examples linked to create an appropriate setup.

LSP configuration is handled through [[https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphql-language-service-cli#graphql-configuration-file-graphqlrcyml][GraphQL Config]] to handle custom
directives/documents/validation etc.

These files will also be useful to other editors, so it would be worth checking
them into version control.
