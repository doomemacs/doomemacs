#+since:     3.0.0 (#COMMIT-OR-PR-REF)

* Description :unfold:
  This module add [[https://openscad.org/][OpenSCAD]] support to Doom Emacs.

This allows you to design complex, 3D models all from the comfort of the editor you love!

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

While the module itself doesn't *technically* require OpenSCAD to be installed, if you want to actually render geometry, you should install it through your distribution's package manager.

#+begin_src shell
apt-get install openscad # Debian / Ubuntu / Kubuntu
yum install openscad # Fedora
pacman -S openscad # Arch Linux
brew install --cask openscad # MacOS
#+end_src

** LSP Server

If you'd like to have language server support, you need to install [[https://github.com/Leathong/openscad-LSP][openscad-lsp]] manually.
This currently isn't packaged by anyone, so you either need to grab a binary from the source or build it manually.

To build it, you need a [[https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started][Rust toolchain]] installed, then you can run

#+begin_src shell
cargo install openscad-lsp
#+end_src

* Usage
To start, create a new =.scad= file and start writing. Once you have some renderable geometry you can render it directly in editor with ~scad-preview~.
Otherwise, you can open in OpenSCAD with ~scad-open~, where by default saves in Emacs will cause a re-render in OpenSCAD.
Once you're happy, you can render to a variety of 3D file formats from within OpenSCAD or to an STL for 3D printing with ~scad-export~.
