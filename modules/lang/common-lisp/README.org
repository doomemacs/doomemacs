* Description :unfold:
This module provides support for [[https://lisp-lang.org/][Common Lisp]] and the [[doom-package:Sly]] development
environment. Common Lisp is not a single language but a specification, with many
competing compiler implementations. By default, [[http://www.sbcl.org/][Steel Bank Common Lisp]] (SBCL) is
assumed to be installed, but this can be configured.

Common Lisp benefits from a mature specification and rich standard library.
Thanks to its powerful REPL and debugger, it boasts an "interactive programming"
style often unseen in other languages. Compiled Common Lisp programs are trusted
to run unmodified for a long time.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module requires [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]].

* TODO Usage
#+begin_quote
 ðŸ”¨ /This module's usage documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

This module does not integrate with [[doom-module::tools lsp]]. Sly (and SLIME before it) is
considered the defacto development environment for Common Lisp and provides much
of what is normally expected of an LSP, plus tight integration with the REPL and
Emacs.

** Sly
Using this module is mostly a matter of using Sly. Please consider reading
through [[http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#A-SLY-tour-for-SLIME-users][the Sly Tour]].

A Sly session will be started when you open a =.lisp= file. Use [[kbd:][<localleader> ']]
to switch to the REPL minibuffer.

** org-mode
This module also enables the evaluation of =lisp= source blocks in Org Mode.
However, you will need a running Sly session for this to work. ~M-x sly~ starts
such a session if you didn't have one open already.

* TODO Configuration

 ðŸ”¨ /This module's configuration documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

If you don't want Sly to use SBCL, you can configure the variable
~inferior-lisp-program~ to some other binary on your PATH.
