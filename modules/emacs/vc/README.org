** Module flags
/This module has no flags./

** Packages
- [[doom-package:browse-at-remote]]
- [[doom-package:git-timemachine]]
- [[doom-package:gitconfig-mode]]
- [[doom-package:gitignore-mode]]

** Hacks
- Allow [[doom-package:browse-at-remote]] commands in [[doom-package:git-timemachine]] buffers to open that file
  in your browser at the visited revision.
- [[doom-package:git-timemachine]] buffers will display revision details in the header-line,
  rather than the minibuffer (easier to see).
- [[doom-package:browse-at-remote]] will fall back to the =master= branch if target is in a
  detached state.
