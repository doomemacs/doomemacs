* Description
[[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][Treemacs]] is a file and project explorer similar to NeoTree or vimâ€™s NerdTree, but largely inspired by the Project Explorer in Eclipse. It shows the file system outlines of your projects in a simple tree layout allowing quick navigation and exploration, while also possessing basic file management utilities.
It includes:

+ Integration with Git  (when =:tools magit= is enabled)
+ Integration with Evil (when =:editor evil +everywhere= is enabled)
+ Workspace awareness (when =:ui workspaces= is enabled)

** Maintainers
+ This module has no dedicated maintainers.

** Module Flags
+ =+lsp= Enable ~lsp-treemacs~ integration and add shortcuts for common commands.

If ~+treemacs-git-mode~ is set to ~extended~ or ~deferred~ you will need to have
~python3~ installed.

* Features
The project bar can be opened using =SPC o p=.

| Keybind | Description                                                     |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| =o s=     | Open a horizontal dired buffer on the currently highlighted node |
| =o v=     | Open a vertical dired buffer on the currently highlighted node  |

* Configuration
The variable ~+treemacs-git-mode~ sets the type of git integration that treemacs
has.

There are 3 possible values:

  1. simple, which highlights only files based on their git status, and is
     slightly faster,
  2. extended, which highlights both files and directories, but requires
     python,
  3. deferred, same as extended, but highlights asynchronously.

the default being simple

This must be set before treemacs has loaded.

* TODO Troubleshooting
# Common issues and their solution, or places to look for help.
