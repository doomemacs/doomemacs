| Keybind | Description                                                     |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| =o s=     | Open a horizontal dired buffer on the currently highlighted node |
| =o v=     | Open a vertical dired buffer on the currently highlighted node  |

* Configuration
the variable ~+treemacs-git-mode~ sets the type of git integration for treemacs

There are 3 possible values:

  1. simple, which highlights only files based on their git status, and is
     slightly faster,
  2. extended, which highlights both files and directories, but requires
     python,
  3. deferred, same as extended, but highlights asynchronously.

the default being simple

This must be set before treemacs has loaded.

* TODO Troubleshooting
# Common issues and their solution, or places to look for help.
