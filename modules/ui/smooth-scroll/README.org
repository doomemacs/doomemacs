* Description :unfold:
This module enables multiple kinds of smooth scrolling in Emacs. Its primary
function is to make input scrolling (on trackpads and scroll wheels)
pixel-smooth. With the =+interpolate= flag, it performs interpolated scrolling on
a growing list of scroll commands that traverse larger distances, smoothly
scrolling from point A to B on PgUp or PgDown (or [[kbd:][C-d]]/[[kbd:][C-u]] for Evil users).

#+begin_quote
  This module requires Emacs 29.1 or newer.

#+begin_quote
  Scroll interpolation support is currently limited to the ~scroll-up~ and
    ~scroll-down~ commands, and any command that calls them (like ~evil-scroll-down~
    and ~evil-scroll-up~), so you're likely to find many scroll commands are not
    interpolated. We welcome PRs to expand its support.

** Module flags
- +interpolate ::
  Enables scroll interpolation for some larger-step scrolling commands. E.g.
  PgUp and PgDown (or C-d/C-u for Evil users) will now smoothly scroll to its
  destination rather than jump to it.

#+begin_quote
  For optimal performance from this module, it's highly recommended you use
    Emacs with native-compilation. MacOS users may also have a better experience
    using the [[https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac][emacs-mac]] fork of Emacs, available via Homebrew.

** Poor scrolling performance by scroll wheel or trackpad
This module "smooths" input scrolling (via your trackpad or mouse wheel), and is
platform agnostic, so long as your OS reports pixel-level scrolling input from
your input hardware. If you run into issues, here are some things to try:

- Use ~M-x ultra-scroll-check~ to diagnose common issues. Visit [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility][ultra-scroll's
  documentation]] for more on interpreting and acting on its results.
- Read [[https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll?tab=readme-ov-file#Speed][ultra-scroll's documentation on scrolling speed]]; it outlines common
  factors that may impact it and how to mitigate them.
- See Doom's "[[https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/why-is-emacs-doom-slow/83/3][Why is Emacs/Doom slow?]]" write-up, where Doom's author documents
  common factors that can slow Emacs down in general (not specifically to do
  with scrolling) and what to do about them.

If all else fails, let us know on [[https://discourse.doomemacs.org][Discourse]] or [[https://doomemacs.org/discord][Discord]]. Only file an issue if
you have a good idea what's causing the problem or have an explicit error to
report (performance issues, in general, tend to be the result of *many* factors
and are the greatest source of false positives on our issue tracker).

** High idle CPU usage with =+interpolate=
This flag will increase Emacs' idle CPU usage. Some overhead is unavoidable with
how [[https://github.com/io12/good-scroll.el][good-scroll]] implements scroll interpolation (with a high-rate timer), but
some builds of and configurations for Emacs are affected worse than others. If
this affects you, here are some ways to help:

- Use, at least, the [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html#Releases][latest stable version of Emacs]]. Later versions are
  significantly more memory and CPU efficient.
- Use native compilation. This is a tremendous boon to Emacs performance in
  general.
- Increase the values for ~good-scroll-render-rate~ (default: ~0.02~) and/or
  ~good-scroll-duration~ (default: ~0.15~). Remember to restart ~good-scroll-mode~ if
  you change these values live. This will decrease the package's poll rate.
- Some UI features can significantly exacerbate this issue, like line numbers.
  Try turning them off.
- PGTK builds seem less affected by this, and MacOS builds seem more affected.
  Try another build. Your mileage may vary.

If nothing helps, report it [[https://github.com/io12/good-scroll.el/issues/31][upstream]]. Until a workaround is found, you must
decide whether this trade-off is worth it for you.
