#+TITLE: :ui doom-modeline

This module customizes the Emacs mode-line.

The DOOM modeline was designed for minimalism, and offers:

+ A match count panel (for ~evil-search~, ~iedit~ and ~evil-substitute~)
+ An indicator for recording a macro
+ Local python/ruby version in the major-mode
+ A customizable mode-line height (see ~+doom-modeline-height~)
+ An error/warning count segment for flycheck

* Install
This module requires the fonts included with ~all-the-icons~ to be installed.

Run ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~ to do so.

* Extracting my modeline
Some might want my modeline without the DOOM config altogether. I've tried to make this easier for you, but there are a few things you'll need to do:

+ Ensure [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] and [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] are installed.
+ Ensure ~projectile-mode~ is enabled.
+ Ensure the fonts included with ~all-the-icons~ are installed (~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~).
+ Replace ~def-package!~ calls with ~use-package~.
+ Replace ~doom-project-root~ calls with ~projectile-project-root~.
+ The ~+doom-modeline--make-xpm~ function is memoized with the ~def-memoized!~ macro. Change ~def-memoized!~ to ~defun~.
+ Copy the ~add-hook!~ macro definition from [[/core/core-lib.el][core/core-lib.el]].
+ Copy the following macros and functions from [[/core/core-ui.el][core/core-ui.el]]:
  + ~def-modeline-segment!~
  + ~def-modeline!~
  + ~doom--prepare-modeline-segments~
  + ~doom-modeline~
  + ~doom-set-modeline~

That /should/ be everything. As I have never used this out of my config I can't guarantee immediate success, but I'd be happy to help you out if you file an issue.

* Troubleshooting
** Where are my minor modes?
I didn't need it, so I removed it. Run ~M-x doom/what-minor-mode~ to investigate what minor modes are currently active.
