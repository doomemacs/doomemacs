* Description
This module provides ~writeroom-mode~, which transforms Emacs into a
comfortable writing or coding space by centering the buffer, removing
superfluous UI elements, and turning on variable-pitch fonts (but keeps certain
elements fixed-pitch, where it makes sense to).

If you've used olivetti, sublimity, or tabula-rasa, you will feel right at home.

** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode][writeroom-mode]]
+ [[https://gitlab.com/jabranham/mixed-pitch][mixed-pitch]]

** Hacks
+ =mixed-pitch= has been modified not to override ~:height~ properties on the
  faces it remaps. This means text-scale can affect the ~fixed-pitch~ faces as
  well; See https://gitlab.com/jabranham/mixed-pitch/issues/6#note_79691741.

* Prerequisites
This module has no prereqisites.

* Features
** Distractions-free mode
This can be activated with =SPC t z= for evil users. There is no keybinding for
non-evil users yet, so use 'M-x writeroom-mode'.

* Configuration
** Enable fullscreen on activation
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq writeroom-fullscreen-effect t)
#+END_SRC

Or fullscreen manually with =SPC t F= (or =F11= for non-evil users).
** Customize the text scaling factor
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq zen-text-scale 1)
#+END_SRC

Provide a value of =nil= or =0= to disable text scaling.
