#+subtitle: One does not simply quit Emacs
#+created:  February 19, 2017
#+since:    2.0.0

* Description :unfold:
A silly module that throws cute confirmation prompts at you when you exit Emacs,
like DOOM (the game) did. Some quotes are from the classic games, others are
random, nerdy references that no decent human being has any business
recognizing.
