;;; ui/popup/+hacks.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; What follows are all the hacks needed to get various parts of Emacs and other
;; plugins to cooperate with the popup management system. Essentially, it comes
;; down to:
;;
;; 1. Making plugins that control their own window environment less greedy (e.g.
;;    org agenda, which tries to reconfigure the entire frame by deleting all
;;    other windows just to pop up one tiny window).
;; 2. Forcing plugins to use `display-buffer' and `pop-to-buffer' instead of
;;    `switch-to-buffer' (which is unaffected by `display-buffer-alist', which
;;    this module heavily relies on).
;; 3. Closing popups (temporarily) before functions that are highly destructive
;;    to the illusion of popup control get run (with the use of the
;;    `save-popups!' macro).
;;
;; Keep in mind, all this black magic may break in future updates, and will need
;; to be watched carefully for corner cases. Also, once this file is loaded,
;; many of its changes are irreversible without restarting Emacs! I don't like
;; it either, but I will address this over time.
;;
;; Hacks should be kept in alphabetical order, named after the feature they
;; modify, and should follow a ;;;## package-name header line (if not using
;; `after!' or `def-package!').
