#+begin_quote
The [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][emojify]] package requires Emacs *v24.3* and above. Emacs should be compiled
with support for *PNG* images to display emojis as images. It is *recommended*
that Emacs is compiled with *ImageMagick* support. ~emojify~ will use it to
resize emojis if needed, additionally imagemagick is used to set background
color for emojis to workaround the bug described in [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify/issues/7][issue 7]]. However these are
*completely optional*.

PNG support might require some additional steps to on Windows, you might find
