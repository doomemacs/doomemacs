#+title:    :ui workspaces
#+subtitle: Tab emulation, persistence, & separate workspaces
#+created:  February 20, 2017
#+since:    2.0.0

* Description :unfold:
This module adds support for workspaces, powered by [[doom-package:persp-mode]], as well as a API
for manipulating them.

#+begin_quote
 ğŸ’¡ There are many ways to use workspaces. I spawn a workspace per task. Say I'm
    working in the main workspace, when I realize there is a bug in another part
    of my project. I open a new workspace and deal with it in there. In the
    meantime, I need to check my email, so mu4e gets its own workspace.

    Once I've completed the task, I close the workspace and return to main.

** Isolated buffer-list
When persp-mode is active, ~doom-buffer-list~ becomes workspace-restricted. You
can overcome this by using ~buffer-list~.

** Automatic workspaces
A workspace is automatically created (and switched to) when you:

- Create a new frame (with =make-frame=; bound to [[kbd:][M-N]] by default).
- Switch to a project using ~projectile-switch-project~.

** Session persistence
By default, your session is autosaved when you quit Emacs (or disable
~persp-mode~). You can load a previous session with ~M-x
+workspace/load-session~ or ~:sl[oad]~ (ex command).

You can supply either a name to load a specific session to replace your current
one.

** Workspace persistence
If you'd like to save a specific workspace, use ~M-x +workspace/save~, which can
be loaded into the current session (as another workspace) with ~M-x
+workspace/load~.

** Commands & Keybindings
Here is a list of available commands, their default keybindings (defined in
[[../../config/default/+evil-bindings.el][config/default/+bindings.el]]), and corresponding ex commands (if any -- defined
in [[../../editor/evil/+commands.el][config/default/+evil-commands.el]]).
