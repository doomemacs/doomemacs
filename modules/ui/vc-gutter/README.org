#+title:    :ui vc-gutter
#+subtitle: Get your diff out of the gutter
#+created:  June 26, 2018
#+since:    21.12.0

* Description :unfold:
This module displays a diff of the current file (against HEAD) in the fringe.
Supports Git, Svn, Hg, and Bzr.

** Module flags
- +diff-hl ::
  Use [[doom-package:diff-hl]] instead of git-gutter to power the VC gutter. It is a little
  faster, but is slightly more prone to visual glitching. [[doom-package:diff-hl]] is intended to
  replace git-gutter at some point in the future.
- +pretty ::
  Apply some stylistic defaults to the fringe, enabling thin bars in the fringe.
  This look takes after the modern look of git-gutter in VSCode and Sublime
  Text, without sacrificing on fringe width (which squeeze other indicators,
  like flycheck's, flymake's, or flyspell's). However, this will look bad with
  themes that invert the foreground/background of either git-gutter's or
  diff-hl's faces (like modus-themes does).

** Packages
- [[doom-package:git-gutter-fringe]] unless [[doom-module:+diff-hl]]
- [[doom-package:diff-hl]] if [[doom-module:+diff-hl]]

** Hacks
- The VC gutter will be updated when pressing ESC, leaving insert mode (evil
  users), or refocusing the frame or window where it is active.
- If [[doom-module:+pretty]] is enabled
  - The fringes that both git-gutter-fringe and diff-hl define will be replaced
    with a set of thin bars. This achieves a slicker look closer to git-gutter's
    appearance in VSCode or Sublime Text, but may look weird for themes that
    swap their faces' :foreground and :background (like modus-themes).
  - The fringes are moved to the outside of the margins (closest to the frame
    edge), so they have some breathing space away from the buffer's contents.
- If [[doom-package:+diff-hl]] is enabled:
  - ~diff-hl-revert-hunk~ displays a preview popup of the hunk being reverted.
    It takes up ~50% of the frame, by default, whether you're reverting 2 lines
    or 20. Since this isn't easily customized, it has been advised to shrink
    this popup to the side of its contents.
  - ~diff-hl-revert-hunk~ will sometimes move the cursor to an unexpected
    location (the bounds of hunks, is my guess), but this is not intuitive and
    often unexpected. Cursor movements have been suppressed for it.
- If +diff-hl is *not* enabled:
  - Sometimes, ~git-gutter:next-hunk~ and ~git-gutter:previous-hunk~ get
    confused about the order of hunks. They have been advised to fix this
    (although the hack is a little inefficient).
