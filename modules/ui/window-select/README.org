#+title:    :ui window-select
#+subtitle: Visually switch windows
#+created:  October 08, 2017
#+since:    2.0.7 (#237)

* Description :unfold:
This module provides several methods for selecting windows without the use of
the mouse or spatial navigation (e.g. [[kbd:][C-w {h,j,k,l}]]).

The command ~other-window~ is remapped to either [[doom-package:switch-window]] or [[doom-package:ace-window]],
depending on which backend you've enabled. It is bound to [[kbd:][C-x o]] (and [[kbd:][C-w C-w]] for
evil users).

It also provides numbered windows and selection with the [[doom-package:winum]] package, if
desired. Evil users can jump to window N in [[kbd:][C-w <N>]] (where N is a number between
0 and 9). Non evil users have [[kbd:][C-x w <N>]] instead.

This module provides two backends, both providing the same functionality, but
with different visual cues. They are [[doom-package:ace-window]] and [[doom-package:switch-window]].

** ace-window
The first character of the buffers changes to a highlighted, user-selectable
character.

- *Pros:* the content of the buffers are always visible.
- *Cons:* The display characters are small and difficult to see (see below for a
  way to enlarge them).
 
*** Custom font-face example
This changes the ace-window display to show a white letter with a red
background. The box attribute adds some padding:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(aw-leading-char-face
    :foreground "white" :background "red"
    :weight bold :height 2.5 :box (:line-width 10 :color "red")))
#+end_src 

** switch-window
Replaces the entire buffer with large letters.

- *Pros:* The displayed characters are /really/ easy to see.
- *Cons:* You can't see the contents of the buffers.
