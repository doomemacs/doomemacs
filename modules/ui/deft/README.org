#+TITLE: :ui deft

[[https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/][Deft]] is a major mode for browsing and filtering notes written in plain text
formats, such as org-mode, markdown, and LaTeX.

To use this module, in your config file set the value of the variable ~deft-directory~ to the folder in which you
want to keep your notes. 

The default note format is org-mode. You can change this by setting the value of
the variable ~deft-default-extension~. Changing the value to ~"md"~ for example,
will change the default note format to markdown.
