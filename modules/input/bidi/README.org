* Description :unfold:
This module improves support for bidirectional text (bidi). Enable it if you
regularly write with languages that read right-to-left. As bidi support is
exceptionally user-specific, read on for additional instructions to customize it
to your needs.

/This module has no external requirements./

* Usage
This module provides ~+bidi-mode~, a minor mode that improves the display of RTL
text by right-aligning lines that start with an RTL language, on a per-line
basis. Since exact use cases vary, turning on this mode is left to the user.

It also provides easy font configuration for Hebrew and Arabic-derived scripts
(Arabic, Persian, Urdu, etc.) in ~+bidi-hebrew-font~ and ~+bidi-arabic-font~.
See [[Fonts]] for more information. If you use an RTL language that isn't covered by
these characters, open an issue requesting support for it.

* Configuration
** Using ~+bidi-mode~
~+bidi-mode~ is a local minor mode, meaning it has to be turned on a per-buffer
basis.

If you want to have it on for all buffers, use ~+bidi-global-mode~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(+bidi-global-mode 1)
#+end_src

If you only need it for specific purposes, e.g. editing LaTeX documents, you
probably want to enable it through a hook:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook #'+bidi-mode)
#+end_src

This is also useful for adding specific functionality for when ~+bidi-mode~ is on.

** Force RTL text alignment
By default, ~+bidi-mode~ will align paragraphs by the first character with
strong directionality. If you want to force all paragraphs to be aligned
right-to-left when ~+bidi-mode~ is on, add the following to your config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +bidi-paragraph-direction 'right-to-left)
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
 ðŸš§ Do not do this if you are using ~+bidi-global-mode~, it will mess up all of
    the buffers in Emacs that use English, including things like the =M-x=
    buffer.
#+end_quote

** Input Methods
If bidi support is needed, it's likely that you want to easily switch between
English and your favorite RTL language. To do this without losing access to all
of the keybindings require English letters, you should use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Input-Methods.html][input methods]] to
switch languages instead of changing the system keyboard language. If you use a
non-qwerty layout, you will need extra configuration to keep the input method
consistent, see [[https://github.com/ymarco/doom-emacs-config/blob/2d655adb6a35c5cd3afcba24e76327f5444cf774/dvorak-config.el#L3-L18][here]] for an example for dvorak.

Toggling the input method bound to [[kbd:][C-\]]. It prompts you to choose an input method
the first time you do this in a session, but you bypass this by setting the
default input method:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq default-input-method "hebrew")
#+end_src

** Fonts
Many good English fonts lack good coverage for RTL languages, especially for
Hebrew and monospace fonts. To this end, we provide [[var:+bidi-hebrew-font]] and
[[var:+bidi-arabic-font]] as an easy way to override the default fonts, but only for
Hebrew and Arabic characters. They are set by default to =DejaVu Sans=, since it
has decent looking Hebrew and Arabic character support.

#+begin_quote
 ðŸ“Œ If you are writing in an Arabic-derived script, such as Persian, Urdu, or
    Pashto, you may want to change ~+bidi-arabic-font~ to one specific to your
    language, especially if you want your script to be written in the Nastaliq
    style.
#+end_quote

If you use an RTL language the script of which isn't covered by the =hebrew= or
=arabic= unicode blocks, you can set a font override manually. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! 'after-setting-font-hook :append
  (set-fontset-font t 'syriac (font-spec :family "DejaVu Sans")))
#+end_src

Make sure to use the correct unicode block name, see the documentation of
[[fn:set-fontset-font]] for more details.

*** Smart Fontify
Since good bidi fonts are often not monospace (as is the default =DejaVu Sans=),
It usually looks better to have the surrounding spaces and punctuation in the
use the bidi font as well. This is the default behaviour, but you can turn this
off by setting:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +bidi-want-smart-fontify nil)
#+end_src

** Change Dictionary Language On Bidi Buffers
If you only use ~+bidi-mode~ in specific buffers, you might want to
automatically change the dictionary language there. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! '+bidi-mode-hook
  (ispell-change-dictionary (if +bidi-mode "hebrew" "default")))
#+end_src

** Automatic input mode switching
You may want Emacs to guess when you want it to switch input methods. See [[https://github.com/ymarco/doom-emacs-config/blob/2d655adb6a35c5cd3afcba24e76327f5444cf774/hebrew-latex-config.el#L7-L21][here]]
and [[https://github.com/ymarco/doom-emacs-config/blob/2d655adb6a35c5cd3afcba24e76327f5444cf774/hebrew-latex-config.el#L99-L102][here]] for an example of how to get Emacs to switch to hebrew when entering
insert mode after a hebrew character, in LaTeX buffers.

** Nastaliq font display bug
If Emacs is having trouble properly displaying a Nastaliq font, try using one of
[[https://urdufonts.net/fonts/jameel-noori-nastaleeq-regular][these]] [[https://urdufonts.net/fonts/alvi-nastaleeq-regular][two]] fonts for [[var:+bidi-arabic-font]].
