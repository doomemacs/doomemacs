* Description :unfold:
This module provides barebones support for using Doom with non-qwerty keyboard
layouts.

** Module flags
- +azerty ::
  Remap keybinds to accommodate the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY][Azerty keyboard layout]].
- +bepo ::
  Remap keybinds to accommodate the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%89PO][BÃ‰PO keyboard layout]] (version 1.1, in
  particular).

** BÃ©po
Support for the bÃ©po layout includes:
- Setting Avy keys to the correct home row keys
- Changing navigation keys to [[kbd:][c]], [[kbd:][t]], [[kbd:][s]], and [[kbd:][r]]
  + old [[kbd:][t]] is mapped to [[kbd:][j]]
  + old [[kbd:][s]] is mapped to [[kbd:][k]] (i.e. staging in the magit status buffer is done with
    [[kbd:][k]])
  + See [[*Configuration][Configuration]] to see where old [[kbd:][c]] and [[kbd:][r]] functions
    are remapped
- Bind [[kbd:][<>]] functions to [[kbd:][Â«Â»]] keys when possible
- Bind [[kbd:][[]]] functions to [[kbd:][()]] keys when possible (the "unimpaired-like" bindings)
- Bind [[kbd:][Ã©]] key to [[kbd:][w]] functions when possible
- Bind [[kbd:][Ã¨]] key to useful functions when possible
- Bind [[kbd:][`~]] functions to [[kbd:][$#]] keys when possible

*** Easymotion
If you use [[doom-package:evil-easymotion]], then all the bindings that were on [[kbd:][gs]] have been
moved to [[kbd:][gÃ©]].

In short : [[kbd:][g s j]] -> [[kbd:][g Ã© t]] (~evilem-motion-next-line~). And so on.

*** Leaving mnemonics alone when possible
Exchanging [[kbd:][h]]/[[kbd:][j]]/[[kbd:][k]]/[[kbd:][l]] to [[kbd:][c]]/[[kbd:][t]]/[[kbd:][s]]/[[kbd:][r]] has the effect of destroying a few mnemonics: the
change operator becomes [[kbd:][l]] for example, or the window split becomes [[kbd:][SPC Ã© k]].

The module tries to limit those changes to the minimum, especially in special
buffers. A concrete example is magit.

As the =magit: project= buffer (obtained with ~M-x magit-status~) does not need
left-right navigation, keys [[kbd:][c]], [[kbd:][r]], [[kbd:][h]], and [[kbd:][l]] keep their "expected" bindings, while
[[kbd:][t]], [[kbd:][s]], [[kbd:][j]], and [[kbd:][k]] are flipped:
- checking the log from a magit buffer is still on [[kbd:][l]]
- staging a file/region has been moved to [[kbd:][k]]

*** Possible contributions
**** Avoid [[kbd:][g]] and [[kbd:][z]] to be used too often
A nice addition in the future might be to have all the normal mode bindings that
start with [[kbd:][g]] start with [[kbd:][,]] instead to avoid the curl on these common bindings.
This is *not* implemented for the time being.

The same thing could be done to [[kbd:][z]], potentially using [[kbd:][Ã ]] instead.

**** Proper minor mode
Also, implementing all those changes as a minor we could flip on and off would
help with adoption

**** Put "word" text objects to Ã© instead of w
"inside word" and "around word" are [[kbd:][iw]] and [[kbd:][aw]], which use the very poorly rated [[kbd:][w]]
key in the bÃ©po layout. Finding a way to use [[kbd:][Ã©]] or even [[kbd:][Ã¨]] more for these would be
a welcome change

*** Org-mode
[[doom-package:evil-org]] allows to define ~evil-org-movement-bindings~ to automatically map
movement bindings on non-hjkl keys. It maps automatically keys to [[kbd:][C-c]] and [[kbd:][C-r]] in
normal and insert states though, and it's not really user friendly in Emacs to
remap those.

Therefore, in ~org-mode~:
- ~org-shiftright~ is bound to [[kbd:][C-Â»]]
- ~org-shiftleft~ is bound to [[kbd:][C-Â«]]

** BÃ©po
=+layout-bepo-cr-rotation-style= controls whether:
- =qwerty-c= functions are mapped on =bÃ©po-l= key, and =qwerty-r= functions on
  =bÃ©po-h= key (~'ergodis~), or
- =qwerty-c= functions are mapped on =bÃ©po-h= key, and =qwerty-r= functions on
  =bÃ©po-l= key (~'strict~)
 
~'strict~ would be the logical choice but the [[kbd:][c]] functions are used more often
than the [[kbd:][r]] ones so [[https://bepo.fr/wiki/Vim#Principe][Ergodis]] advises to actually put all the [[kbd:][c]] functions on the
key that does not need a curl.

* Troubleshooting
[[doom-report:][Report an issue?]]

** Outstanding issues (contributions welcome)
*** BÃ©po
- In [[doom-package:eshell]], the key [[kbd:][c]] is still bound to ~evil-collection-eshell-evil-change~ in
  normal mode.
  
** How to investigate an issue ?
If a key is misbehaving, use ~M-x describe-key~ ([[kbd:][C-h k]] or [[kbd:][SPC h k]] or [[kbd:][F1 k]]) to
see the command bound to the key, and more importantly in which keymap it is
bound.

You should ignore all ~evil-collection-*-backup-map~ keymaps, as they are
artifacts from ~evil-collection-translate-key~ and those maps are actually not
active.

Most likely the solution is to call one of the "key rotation" functions on the
relevant keymaps.

** How to deactivate the new bindings and go back to the old ones ?
If you are learning a new layout you might want to go back to tho old one to
"get work done". Sadly the only way is to comment out the module, run ~$ doom
sync~ and restart emacs.

Restoring the session [[kbd:][SPC q l]] by default helps to lower the impact of the
restart.
