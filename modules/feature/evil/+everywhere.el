;;; feature/evil/+everywhere.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; We load evil-collection ourselves for these reasons:
;;
;; 1. To truly lazy load it. Some of its modules, like the elisp-mode and
;;    buff-menu ones are loaded immediately, because Emacs loads them
;;    immediately, pulling in all of evil-collection and sometimes other
;;    packages.
;; 2. This ensures a predictable load order, versus lazy loading using :defer or
;;    :after-call. This means users can use (after! org ...) and be sure that
;;    their changes will override evil-collection's.
;; 3. Eventually, I'd like to remove evil-collection. It changes too often,
;;    introduces breaking bugs too frequently, and I don't always agree with
;;    their design choices. Regardless, there are useful tidbits I'd like to
;;    keep. This will be a slow transition, but this file is where most of it
;;    will happen.
;; 4. Adds `+evil-collection-disabled-list', to make it easier for users to
;;    disable modules, and to reduce the effort required to maintain our copy of
;;    `evil-collection-list' (now I can just copy it from time to time).
