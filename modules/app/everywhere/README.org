* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module requires:
- *On Linux:* (these should be available through your OS package manager)
  - =xclip=
  - =xdotool=
  - =xprop=
  - =xwininfo=
- *On MacOS:* that Emacs is allowed to "control your computer" under *System
  Preferences > Accessibility*.

* Usage
To use this, invoke the =emacs-everywhere= executable. This can be done in two
ways:
- ~$ emacsclient --eval "(emacs-everywhere)"~
- ~$ doom +everywhere~

It is recommended that you add a keybinding for this.

From here, you can edit away to your hearts content in the created frame, then
return to the original window and paste the content with [[kbd:][C-c C-c]] or [[kbd:][SPC q f]]. To
exit without pasting, use [[kbd:][C-c C-k]].

* Configuration
[[doom-package:emacs-everywhere]] likes to guess if you triggered it from an application which
supports markdown. Configure ~emacs-everywhere-markdown-windows~ and
~emacs-everywhere-markdown-apps~ to improve how accurate this is on your system.

By default, when markdown is detected, ~markdown-mode~ is used. It is possible
to instead use pandoc to convert the content to Org (and export to markdown when
closing the frame) by setting ~emacs-everywhere-major-mode-function~ to
~#'org-mode~.

Most other behavior is implemented as hooks on ~emacs-everywhere-init-hooks~.
