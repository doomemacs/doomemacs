* Description
This module integrates [[https://langserver.org/][language servers]] into Doom Emacs. They provide features
you'd expect from IDEs, like code completion, realtime linting, language-aware
imenu/xref integration, jump-to-definition/references support, and more.

To get LSP working, you'll need to do three things:

1. Enable this module,
2. Install a language server appropriate for your targeted language(s) (you'll
   find a table mapping languages to available servers [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#supported-languages][in the lsp-mode project
   README]]).
3. Enable the =+lsp= flag on the =:lang= modules you want to enable LSP support
   for. If your language's module doesn't have LSP support, and you know it can
   (or should), please let us know! In the meantime, you must configure it
   yourself (described in the Configuration section).

As of this writing, this is the state of LSP support in Doom Emacs:

** Module Flags
+ =+peek= Use =lsp-ui-peek= when looking up definitions and references with
  functionality from the =:tools lookup= module.
+ =+eglot= Use [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/eglot.html][Eglot]] instead of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][LSP-mode]] to implement the LSP client in
  Emacs.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]]
+ [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]]
+ [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]]
+ [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/helm-lsp][helm-lsp]]
+ [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]

** Hacks
+ ~lsp-mode~ has been modified not to automatically install missing LSP servers.
  This is done to adhere to our "Your system, your rules" mantra, which insist
  that it is better etiquette to let the user decide when their development
  environment is modified. Use ~M-x lsp-install-server~ to install LSP servers
  manually.

* Prerequisites
This module has no direct prerequisites, but major-modes require you to install
language servers.

You'll find a table that lists available language servers and how to install
them [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#supported-languages][in the lsp-mode project README]]. The documentation of the module for your
targeted language will contain brief instructions as well.

For eglot users, you can see the list of [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/blob/master/README.md#connecting-to-a-server][default servers supported in the README]].
There is also instructions to add another server easily.

* TODO Features
** LSP-powered project search
Without the =+eglot= flag, and when =:completion ivy= or =:completion helm= is
active, LSP is used to search a symbol indexed by the LSP server :
| Keybind   | Description                         |
|-----------+-------------------------------------|
| =SPC c j= | Jump to symbol in current workspace |
| =SPC c J= | Jump to symbol in any workspace     |
** Differences between eglot and lsp-mode
Entering the debate about which one to use would be useless. Doom provides an
easy way to switch out lsp client implementations so you can test for yourself
which one you prefer.

Mainly, from a code point of view, lsp-mode has a lot of custom code for UI
(=lsp-ui-peek=, =lsp-ui-sideline=, ...), while eglot is more barebones with a
closer integration with "more basic" emacs packages (=eldoc=, =xref=, ...).

* TODO Configuration

* TODO Troubleshooting
** My language server is not found
Check the entry in the [[../../../docs/faq.org][FAQ]] about "Doom can't find my executables/doesn't inherit
the correct ~PATH~"
** LSP/Eglot is not started automatically in my buffer
Make sure that you added the =+lsp= flag to the language you're using too in
your init.el :
#+BEGIN_SRC diff
:lang
-python
+(python +lsp)
#+END_SRC
