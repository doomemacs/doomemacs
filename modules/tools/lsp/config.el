This can be overridden by `+lsp-capf-blacklist'.

While `company-capf' does not require the `company-lsp' package and should offer
better performance, it has been integrated into lsp only recently and as of
02/25/2020 is known to cause issues with some language servers. If you wish to
use `company-capf' in general but fall back to `company-lsp' for specific
language servers, set `+lsp-company-backend' to `company-capf' and add the
excluded servers' identifiers to `+lsp-capf-blacklist'.")
