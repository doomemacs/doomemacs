* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

Then check out the [[https://github.com/svaante/dape?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-debug-adapters][install instructions for the debug adapters]] you want to work
with.

#+begin_quote
  Dape's documentation will instruct you to install debug adapters to
    =$EMACSDIR/debug-adapters/=, but Doom uses =$DOOMDIR/debug-adapters/= instead!
    Alter [[var:][dape-adapter-dir]] to change this.

* Usage
Start the debugger with ~M-x +debugger/start~ (bound to [[kbd:][<leader> o d]]). You'll be
prompted to enter a debugger configuration to launch (use [[kbd:][<up>]]/[[kbd:][<down>]] to
traverse your history of debugger configs).

Once the session is started, it can be terminated by ~M-x +debugger/quit~.
