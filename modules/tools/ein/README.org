* Description
Adds Jupyter notebook integration into emacs.

** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook][ein]]

* Prerequisites
This module has no prereqisites.

* Features
** Interaction with a Jupyter server
Three functions are available to start EIN:

 1. ~ein:jupyter-server-start~ --- Start a jupyter server within emacs
 2. ~ein:notebooklist-login~ --- Login to an existing jupyter server
 3. ~ein:notebooklist-open~ --- Open the list of jupyter notebooks

These functions do not have default key bindings.

When ~ein:jupyter-server-start~ is called, after successfully finishing,
~ein:notebooklist-login~ and ~ein:notebooklist-open~ will be automatically
called.

When in the ~Notebook List~ buffer, the key =o= calls ~ace-link~ to speed up the
process of selecting links in the buffer.

If ~company-mode~ is enabled as a module, ~company-ein~ will handle completion.

* Configuration
** Setting the default location of your notebooks
Change ~+ein-notebook-dir~ to tell ein where to find your Jupityr notebooks.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq +ein-notebook-dir "~/my-notebooks")
#+END_SRC

** Using hydra
This module provides a batteries-included hydra - ~+ein-hydra~ - to make using ein
easier. Things like navigating between cells, workbook management etc, are greatly
simplified and are easily accessible. However, by default, it's not bound to any key.
Here's an example of how to bind it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map! :map ein:notebook-mode-map
      :localleader
      "," #'+ein-hydra/body)
#+END_SRC
