* Description
This module provides Magit, an interface to the Git version control system.

If you are new to Magit, see the [[https://github.com/magit/magit#getting-started][Getting Started]] section of its project readme.

** Maintainers
This module has no dedicated maintainers.

** Module Flags
+ =+forge= Enable Forge; a porcelain for managing issues and PRs from within
  Emacs. Will take a while on first run to build emacsql-sqlite.
+ =+delta= Enable magit-delta; syntax-highlighted diffs with [[https://github.com/dandavison/delta][delta]]

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]]
+ [[https://github.com/magit/forge][forge]]* (=+forge=)
+ [[https://github.com/dandavison/magit-delta][magit-delta]]* (=+delta=)

+ [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-magit][evil-magit]]* (=:editor evil +everywhere=)

** Hacks
+ =forge= was modified to defer compilation of emacsql-sqlite until you try to
  use forge, rather than when magit first loads (which could be as soon as
  startup).
+ =magit= has been modified to recognize
  =$XDG_CACHE_HOME/git/credential/socket=.
+ =magit= has been modified to invalidate the projectile cache when you check
  out a new branch or commit.
+ =magit= has been modified to revert repo buffers (e.g. after changing
  branches) when you later switch to them, rather than all at once.

* Prerequisites
This module requires ~git~.

Forge will require [[https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Token-Creation.html#Token-Creation][a Github API token]] the first time you run =forge-pull=.
