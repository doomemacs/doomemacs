* Description
This module provides Magit, an interface to the Git version control system.

If you are new to Magit, see the [[https://github.com/magit/magit#getting-started][Getting Started]] section of its project readme.

** Maintainers
This module has no dedicated maintainers.

** Module Flags
+ =+forge= Enable Forge; a porcelain for managing issues and PRs from within
  Emacs. Will take a while on first run to build emacsql-sqlite.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]]
+ [[https://github.com/magit/forge][forge]]* (=+forge=)
+ [[https://github.com/jtatarik/magit-gitflow][magit-gitflow]]
+ [[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos][magit-todos]]
+ [[https://github.com/charignon/github-review][github-review]]
+ [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-magit][evil-magit]]* (=:editor evil +everywhere=)

** Hacks
+ =forge= was modified to defer compilation of emacsql-sqlite until you try to
  use forge, rather than when magit first loads (which could be as soon as
  startup).
+ =magit= has been modified to recognize
  =$XDG_CACHE_HOME/git/credential/socket=.
+ =magit= has been modified to invalidate the projectile cache when you check
  out a new branch or commit.
+ =magit= has been modified to revert repo buffers (e.g. after changing
  branches) when you later switch to them, rather than all at once.

* Prerequisites
This module requires ~git~.

Forge will require [[https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Token-Creation.html#Token-Creation][a Github API token]] the first time you run =forge-pull=.

* TODO Features
# An in-depth list of features, how to use them, and their dependencies.

* Configuration
Add these to =$DOOMDIR/config.el=.
** Enable Gravatars
This will enable gravatars when viewing commits. The service used by default is [[https://www.libravatar.org/][Libravatar]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq magit-revision-show-gravatars '("^Author:     " . "^Commit:     "))
#+END_SRC

** Enable granular diff-highlights for all hunks

By default, changes are highlighted *linewise* for all but the selected hunk. This
has [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Performance.html][performance reasons]]. You can enable character-wise highlights for all
visible hunks with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! magit
  (setq magit-diff-refine-hunk 'all))
#+END_SRC

* TODO Troubleshooting
# Common issues and their solution, or places to look for help.
