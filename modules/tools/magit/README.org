* Description :unfold:
This module provides Magit, an interface to the Git version control system.

** Maintainers
- [[doom-user:][@hlissner]]

[[doom-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
- +forge ::
  Enable Forge; a porcelain for managing Github issues and PRs from within
  Emacs. Will take a while on first run to build =emacsql-sqlite=. *Requires Emacs
  29.1 or newer.*

** Packages
- [[doom-package:evil-magit]] if [[doom-module::editor evil +everywhere]]
- [[doom-package:forge]] if [[doom-module:+forge]]
- [[doom-package:code-review]] if [[doom-module:+forge]]
- [[doom-package:magit]]

** Hacks
- [[doom-package:magit]] has been modified to recognize =$XDG_CACHE_HOME/git/credential/socket=.
- [[doom-package:magit]] has been modified to invalidate the projectile cache when you check out
  a new branch or commit.
- [[doom-package:magit]] has been modified to revert repo buffers (e.g. after changing branches)
  when you later switch to them, rather than all at once.
- [[doom-package:forge]] was modified to defer compilation of emacsql-sqlite until you try to use
  forge, rather than when magit first loads (which could be as soon as startup).

- [[doom-module:+forge]] requires [[https://magit.vc/manual/forge/Token-Creation.html#Token-Creation][a Github API token]]
- [[doom-package:code-review]] will also require a token setup (see [[https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/code-review#configuration][configuration]] for your particular forge)

* TODO Usage

** Opening magit
Start magit with ~SPC g g~ (=M-x magit-status=) in the current project.

- ~S~ - stage all unstaged changes
- ~U~ - unstage all staged changes

- ~c~ - open commit menu
  - ~c~ - create a commit
  - ~a~ - amend the last commit
  - ~e~ - extend the last commit

*** Pushing and pulling
- ~P~ - push menu
  - ~p~ - push to default remote
- ~F~ - pull/fetch menu
  - ~p~ - pull from default remote
  - ~f~ - fetch from default remote

*** Branching

  - ~b~ - checkout existing branch
  - ~c~ - create and checkout new branch

*** Other operations
- ~z~ - stash menu

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 /This module's configuration documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

** Enable Gravatars
To enable gravatars when viewing commits:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(after! magit
  (setq magit-revision-show-gravatars '("^Author:     " . "^Commit:     ")))
#+end_src

** Enable granular diff-highlights for all hunks
By default, changes are highlighted *linewise* for all but the selected hunk.
This is so for [[https://magit.vc/manual/magit/Performance.html][performance reasons]]. You can enable character-wise highlights for
/all/ visible hunks with:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(after! magit
  (setq magit-diff-refine-hunk 'all))
#+end_src

* Troubleshooting
/There are no known problems with this module./ [[doom-report:][Report one?]]

* Frequently asked questions
** "I recently updated and now I get 'deferred error : (wrong-type-argument sequencep code-review--auth-token-set\?)' whenever I try to review'"
The previous package "github-review" was replaced with a package that supercedes it called "code-review", which requires a simple change in your authinfo file.

#+begin_src authinfo
machine api.github.com login yourlogin^github-review password MYTOKENGOESHERE
#+end_src

becomes

#+begin_src authinfo
machine api.github.com login yourlogin^code-review password MYTOKENGOESHERE
#+end_src
