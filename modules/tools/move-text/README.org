* Move-text
Does not support evil visual. Plans are to fix at the source for evil support rather than make it doom specific.

Adds:
    ~M-up~ move-text-up (line or active region)
    ~M-down~ move-text-down (line or active region)
If evil:
    ~M-k~ move-text-up (line)
    ~M-j~ move-text-down (line)

* TODO
Fix evil support at move-text
