* Description :unfold:
This module integrates [[https://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] into Emacs, allowing users to dictate code
style on a per-project basis with an =.editorconfig= file ([[https://editorconfig-specification.readthedocs.io/][formal
specification]]).

** Module flags
/This module has no flags./

** Packages
- [[doom-package:editorconfig-emacs]]
 
** Hacks
- Added logic to guess an extension-less file's type from its shebang line. For
  example, editorconfig rules for =*.py= files will apply to =bin/myscript=
  assuming its first line is ~#!/usr/bin/env python~. See
  ~+editorconfig-mode-alist~ for adding support for more languages.
- *Special integration for =dtrt-indent=:* If the local editorconfig file
  specifies ~indent_style~ or ~indent_size~, the [[doom-package:dtrt-indent]] (which tries to
  guess your indent settings by analyzing your text file) will bow out.
- *Special integration for =ws-butler=:* this module will use [[doom-package:ws-butler]] to
  enforce ~trim_trailing_whitespace~.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module has one optional dependency: the ~editorconfig~ native binary.
Without it, a built-in elisp implementation will be used, but it has fewer
features and can be a bit slower.

The editorconfig binary has [[https://github.com/editorconfig#contributing][many implementations]] you can choose from, typically
available through your OS package manager (or build it yourself).

* Usage
You will need to write an ~.editorconfig~ file in your project (this is usually
in the root of your project) you can find out about all the properties [[https://editorconfig.org/#example-file][here]].

** Adding support for more major modes
Out the box, the editorconfig plugin supports many Emacs major modes, but it's
possible you'll find one it doesn't support. Adding support is easy so long as
you know that mode's indentation variables. For example, ~coffee-mode~ has a
~coffee-tab-width~ variable that controls indentation width in CoffeeScript
files. Editorconfig already supports this language, but let's pretend it
doesn't:

The ~editorconfig-indentation-alist~ variable contains a list of major modes and
their indentation variables. To add coffee-mode to it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(after! editorconfig
  (add-to-list 'editorconfig-indentation-alist '(coffee-mode coffee-tab-width)))
#+end_src

But what if you don't know the correct indentation variable(s). Use [[kbd:][SPC h v]] ([[kbd:][C-h
v]] for non-evil users) to peruse all the available variables in your current
session of Emacs. Look for variables that have the words =indent=, =offset= or
=tab-width= in them. They will be prefixed with the plugin they belong to (e.g.
~rustic-indent-offset~).
