* Description :unfold:
This module adds [[https://editorconfig.org/][EditorConfig]] support to Emacs, allowing users to dictate code
style on a per-project basis with =.editorconfig= files ([[https://editorconfig-specification.readthedocs.io/][formal specification]]),
with or without the native editorconfig binary.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module has one optional dependency: the native ~editorconfig~ binary.
Without it, a built-in elisp implementation will be used, which is claimed to be
faster and more secure.

If you choose to install the binary, [[https://github.com/editorconfig#contributing][many implementations]] are available, usually
through your OS package manager (if not built from source yourself).

* Usage
A ~.editorconfig~ file in your project (usually in the root directory of the
project) is needed to configure code style for files in the same directory or
below. Documentation on editorconfig's properties can be found [[https://editorconfig.org/#example-file][here]].

** Adding support for more major modes
Out the box, the editorconfig plugin supports many Emacs major modes, but it's
possible you'll find one it doesn't support. Adding support is easy so long as
you know that mode's indentation variables. For example, ~coffee-mode~ has a
~coffee-tab-width~ variable that controls indentation width in CoffeeScript
files. Editorconfig already supports this language, but let's pretend it
doesn't:

The ~editorconfig-indentation-alist~ variable contains a list of major modes and
their indentation variables. To add coffee-mode to it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $DOOMDIR/config.el
(after! editorconfig
  (add-to-list 'editorconfig-indentation-alist '(coffee-mode coffee-tab-width)))
#+end_src

But what if you don't know the correct indentation variable(s). Use [[kbd:][SPC h v]] ([[kbd:][C-h
v]] for non-evil users) to peruse all the available variables in your current
session of Emacs. Look for variables that have the words =indent=, =offset= or
=tab-width= in them. They will be prefixed with the plugin they belong to (e.g.
~rustic-indent-offset~).
