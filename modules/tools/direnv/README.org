#+title:    :tools direnv
#+subtitle: Save (or destroy) the environment at your leisure
#+created:  April 05, 2019
#+since:    21.12.0

* Description :unfold:
This module integrates direnv into Emacs.

#+begin_quote
 󰐃 direnv is an environment switcher for the shell. It knows how to hook into
    bash, zsh, tcsh, fish shell and elvish to load or unload environment
    variables depending on the current directory. This allows project-specific
    environment variables without cluttering the ~/.profile file.

    Before each prompt, direnv checks for the existence of a ".envrc" file in
    the current and parent directories. If the file exists (and is authorized),
    it is loaded into a bash sub-shell and all exported variables are then
    captured by direnv and then made available to the current shell.

** Module flags
/This module has no flags./

** Packages
- [[doom-package:envrc]]

** Hacks
- ~envrc-mode~ has been modified to fail gracefully if ~direnv~ isn't available.
- ~envrc-global-mode~ has been modified to activate envrc-mode sooner in the
  major mode activation process, so that any env state performed in mode hooks
  aren't overwritten by direnv.
- Added direnv support for Org src blocks.

* TODO Usage
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 /This module's usage documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

To make use of direnv you need a =.envrc= file in a directory. Any time you open
a file or buffer in said directory, the [[doom-package:envrc]] Emacs package will kick in,
activate the local env, and inject it into Emacs for the current buffer.

* TODO Configuration

* Troubleshooting
[[doom-report:][Report an issue?]]

** direnv + nix is slow
Consider augmenting direnv with [[https://github.com/nix-community/lorri][lorri]], which will cache nix builds and speed up
direnv tremendously:
#+begin_src nix
services.lorri.enable = true;
#+end_src
