* Description
This module adds [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][tree-sitter]] support to doom:

#+begin_quote
Tree sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It
can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the
syntax tree as the source file is edited.
#+end_quote

It includes:
+ Better syntax highlighting of supported languages
+ Structural text objects to manipulate functions statements and other code
  structures like any other text object

* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features
** Language support
Currently Emacs tree sitter has got [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/tree/master/repos][parsers for these languages]] with syntax
highlighting support for [[https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/syntax-highlighting/][these languages]].

** Text Objects
Not all language support all text objects (yet). [[https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects#built-in-textobjects][Here is a table of the text
objects languages support]]
Note: only languages with parsers in emacs have text object support currently.
Currently text objects are bound to:
| key | text object |
|-----+-------------|
| =f=   | function    |
| =C=   | class       |
| =c=   | comment     |
| =i=   | conditional |
| =l=   | loop        |

They are used in a container context (not =vf= but =vaf= or =vif=)

* TODO Troubleshooting
