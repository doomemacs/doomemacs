#+title:    :completion ivy
#+subtitle: Yesterday's lightest search engine
#+created:  February 20, 2017
#+since:    2.0.0

* Description :unfold:
This module provides Ivy integration for a variety of Emacs commands, as well as
a unified interface for project search and replace, powered by [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/][ripgrep]].

#+begin_quote
I prefer ivy over ido for its flexibility. I prefer ivy over helm because it's
lighter, simpler and faster in many cases.

** Maintainers
/This module has no dedicated maintainers./ [[doom-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
- +childframe ::
  Display Ivy windows in a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Child-Frames.html][child frame]] rather than an popup buffer. *Requires
  GUI Emacs.*
- +fuzzy ::
  Enable fuzzy completion for Ivy searches.
- +icons ::
  Enable file icons for switch-{buffer,project}/find-file commands.
- +prescient ::
  Enable prescient filtering and sorting for Ivy searches.

** Packages
- [[doom-package:all-the-icons-ivy]]* if [[doom-module:+icons]]
- [[doom-package:amx]]
- [[doom-package:counsel]]
- [[doom-package:counsel-projectile]]
- [[doom-package:flx]]* if [[doom-module:+fuzzy]]
- [[doom-package:ivy]]
- [[doom-package:ivy-hydra]]
- [[doom-package:ivy-posframe]]* if [[doom-module:+childframe]]
- [[doom-package:ivy-rich]]
- [[doom-package:prescient]]* if [[doom-module:+prescient]]
- [[doom-package:swiper]]
- [[doom-package:wgrep]]

** Hacks
- Functions with ivy/counsel equivalents have been globally remapped (like
  ~find-file~ => ~counsel-find-file~). So a keybinding to ~find-file~ will
  invoke ~counsel-find-file~ instead.
- ~counsel-[arp]g~'s 3-character limit was reduced to 1 (mainly for the ex
  command)

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~doom!~ block.]]

This module has only one requirement: [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][Ripgrep]], which is a hard dependency of
Doom itself, so you should already have it installed.

Otherwise, Counsel (an Ivy plugin) provides many commands to interface with a
variety of programs from [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] to [[https://kapeli.com/dash][Dash docsets]] to [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] and /much/ more. These
programs are optional for this module, but must be installed if you intend to
use their associated Helm command or plugin.

* TODO Usage
#+begin_quote
 ðŸ”¨ /This module's usage documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

[[doom-package:ivy]] is a /large/ framework for completing things. Covering all its features is
not within the scope of this module's documentation, so only its highlights will
be covered here.

** Jump-to navigation
Inspired by Sublime Text's jump-to-anywhere, CtrlP/Unite in Vim, and Textmate's
Command-T, this module provides similar functionality by bringing [[doom-package:projectile]] and
[[doom-package:ivy]] together.

| Keybind          | Description                         |
|------------------+-------------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][SPC p f]], [[kbd:][SPC SPC]] | Jump to file in project             |
| [[kbd:][SPC f f]], [[kbd:][SPC .]]   | Jump to file from current directory |
| [[kbd:][SPC s i]]          | Jump to symbol in file              |

** Project search & replace
This module provides interactive text search and replace using ripgrep.

| Keybind | Description              |
|---------+--------------------------|
| [[kbd:][SPC s p]] | Search project           |
| [[kbd:][SPC s P]] | Search another project   |
| [[kbd:][SPC s d]] | Search this directory    |
| [[kbd:][SPC s D]] | Search another directory |

https://assets.doomemacs.org/completion/ivy/search.png

Prefixing these keys with the universal argument (=SPC u= for evil users; =C-u=
otherwise) changes the behavior of these commands, instructing the underlying
search engine to include ignored files.

This module also provides Ex Commands for evil users:
| Ex command             | Description                                                      |
|------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~:pg[rep][!] [QUERY]~  | Search project (if ~!~, include hidden files)                    |
| ~:pg[rep]d[!] [QUERY]~ | Search from current directory (if ~!~, don't search recursively) |

The optional `!` is equivalent to the universal argument for the previous
commands.

-----

These keybindings are available while a search is active:
| Keybind | Description                                   |
|---------+-----------------------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][C-c C-o]] | Open a buffer with your search results        |
| [[kbd:][C-c C-e]] | Open a writable buffer of your search results |
| [[kbd:][C-SPC]]   | Preview the current candidate                 |
| [[kbd:][C-RET]]   | Open the selected candidate in other-window   |

Changes to the resulting wgrep buffer (opened by [[kbd:][C-c C-e]]) can be committed with
[[kbd:][C-c C-c]] and aborted with [[kbd:][C-c C-k]] (alternatively [[kbd:][ZZ]] and [[kbd:][ZQ]], for evil users).

** In-buffer searching
The [[doom-package:swiper]] package provides an interactive buffer search powered by ivy. It
can be invoked with:

- [[kbd:][SPC s s]] (~swiper-isearch~)
- [[kbd:][SPC s S]] (~swiper-isearch-thing-at-point~)
- [[kbd:][SPC s b]] (~swiper~)
- ~:sw[iper] [QUERY]~

https://assets.doomemacs.org/completion/ivy/swiper.png

A wgrep buffer can be opened from swiper with [[kbd:][C-c C-e]].
