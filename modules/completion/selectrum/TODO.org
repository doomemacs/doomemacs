* PROJ List of things not working
** TODO Add vanilla keybindings
*** TODO Add keybinding for embark-act
** TODO =SPC s s= and =SPC s S= ~:sw~
There isn't really a selectrum analogue to ~swiper-isearch~, ~consult-isearch~
does something else (give you previously used isearch search terms).
** TODO =C-SPC= and live previews
Automatic live previews have been globally disabled for speed purposes.
=C-SPC= is partially implemented with the preview key for ~consult-*~ commands.
Need to get it to work for other selectrum commands such =SPC h f=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ((embark-quit-after-action nil))
    (map! :map minibuffer-local-map "C-SPC" #'embark-default-action)))
#+end_src
gets us close but moves the cursor to the new screen which is undesirable.
* PROJ List of things needed for Ivy parity
** TODO Icons
https://github.com/minad/marginalia/issues/59
** TODO make backspace work in filepath searching
In ivy, backspace on =/foo/bar/!= (where =!= is the cursor) leads to =/foo/!=
In selectrum, it leads to =/foo/bar!=
** TODO =SPC s B=
** TODO modules to look over
- lookup
- taskrunner (doesn't seem to be an interface yet)
- pass (creating embark-pass can't be that hard)
- irc
- org (check, might be fine)
- counsel-minibuffer-history analogue
- counsel-company analogue
- bibtex
* PROJ Other
** TODO bind =consult-lsp-diagnostics= to something?
** TODO test out bibtex-actions, check if more configuration should be added
