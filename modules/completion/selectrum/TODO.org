* PROJ List of things not working
** TODO Functions very slow on startup:
- =consult-recent-files=
- =consult-bookmark=
preview deactivated for now (see consult use-package)
** TODO Add vanilla keybindings
*** TODO Add keybinding for embark-act
** TODO =SPC s s= and =SPC s S= ~:sw~
There isn't really a selectrum analogue to ~swiper-isearch~, ~consult-isearch~
does something else (give you previously used isearch search terms).
** TODO fix C-SPC
currently after executing the action it:
- moves the cursor to the new window if created, might not be desired in all cases
- for some reason opens buffers in a new window (might be upstream bug?)
* PROJ List of things needed for Ivy parity
** TODO Icons
https://github.com/minad/marginalia/issues/59
** TODO make backspace work in filepath searching
In ivy, backspace on =/foo/bar/!= (where =!= is the cursor) leads to =/foo/!=
In selectrum, it leads to =/foo/bar!=
** TODO =SPC s B=
** TODO ~:pg~ support
* PROJ Other
** TODO bind =consult-lsp-diagnostics= to something?
