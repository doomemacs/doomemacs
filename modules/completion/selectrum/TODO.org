** TODO Functions very slow on startup:
- =consult-recent-files=
- =consult-bookmark=
Probably due to live preview, but gets much faster on subsequent calls.
** TODO Add vanilla keybindings
*** TODO Add keybinding for embark-act
* PROJ List of things needed for Ivy parity
** TODO Icons
https://github.com/minad/marginalia/issues/59
** TODO make backspace work in filepath searching

In selectrum, it leads to =/foo/bar!=
** TODO =SPC s B=
* PROJ Other
** TODO bind =consult-lsp-diagnostics= to something?
