* PROJ Design Decisions
** TODO bind =consult-lsp-diagnostics= to something?
** TODO Make sure we have all vanilla keybindings
** TODO Add keybinding for embark-act outside of the minibuffer
** TODO consider dropping prescient flag
** TODO =SPC s s= and =SPC s S= ~:sw~ ?
There isn't really a selectrum analogue to ~swiper-isearch~, ~consult-isearch~
does something else (give you previously used isearch search terms).

* PROJ Bugs
** TODO =C-SPC= and live previews
Automatic live previews have been disabled on slow ~consult~ commands.
=C-SPC= is partially implemented as the preview key for ~consult-*~ commands.
Need to get it to work for other selectrum commands such =SPC h f=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ((embark-quit-after-action nil))
    (map! :map minibuffer-local-map "C-SPC" #'embark-default-action)))
#+end_src
gets us close but moves the cursor to the new screen which is undesirable.
probable best strategy: create an ~embark-preview~ that does this, upstream it.
** TODO ~consult-theme~ is buggy
something to do with doom theme loading modifications
** TODO ripgrep height logic bad
selectrum bug caused by file descriptors
https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/issues/491
** TODO ~(defadvice! +orderless-match-with-one-face..~ causes lexical error
probably caused by some doomism
https://github.com/oantolin/orderless/issues/41

* PROJ Missing Features
** TODO Icons
https://github.com/minad/marginalia/issues/59
** TODO =C-C C-e= wgrep fun
check if we can add this to ~consult-line~ too
** TODO bibtex-actions improvements?
currently =SPC n b= is bound to a function, but =bibtex-actions= doesn't have a
main dispatch function like =ivy-bibtex=, rather it has a bunch of different
ones. Binding the ~bibtex-actions-map~ there would probably be better, but there
are nontrivial loading order shenanigans happening that make that not straightforward.
** TODO Ivy Parity
*** TODO lookup module
*** TODO taskrunner module (doesn't seem to be an interface yet)
*** TODO pass module (creating embark-pass can't be that hard)
*** TODO ~+irc/ivy-jump-to-channel~ analogue
*** TODO =SPC s B= (~swiper-all~ analogue)
