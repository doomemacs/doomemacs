* PROJ List of things not working
** TODO Add vanilla keybindings
*** TODO Add keybinding for embark-act
** TODO =SPC s s= and =SPC s S= ~:sw~
There isn't really a selectrum analogue to ~swiper-isearch~, ~consult-isearch~
does something else (give you previously used isearch search terms).
** TODO =C-SPC= and live previews
Automatic live previews have been globally disabled for speed purposes.
=C-SPC= is partially implemented with the preview key for ~consult-*~ commands.
Need to get it to work for other selectrum commands such =SPC h f=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ((embark-quit-after-action nil))
    (map! :map minibuffer-local-map "C-SPC" #'embark-default-action)))
#+end_src
gets us close but moves the cursor to the new screen which is undesirable.

** TODO bind =consult-lsp-diagnostics= to something?
** TODO bibtex-actions improvements?
currently =SPC n b= is bound to a function, but =bibtex-actions= doesn't have a
main dispatch function like =ivy-bibtex=, rather it has a bunch of different
ones. Binding the ~bibtex-actions-map~ there would probably be better, but there
are nontrivial loading order shinanigans happening that make that not straightforward.
