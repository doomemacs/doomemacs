* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features

Selectrum and friends modify and use the built-in ~completing-read~ function,
used by any function that requires completion. Due to this the full scope of
these packages is too large to cover here, so we will detail Doom-specific
additions:

** Jump-to navigation
This module provides an interface to navigate within a project using
=projectile=:

https://assets.doomemacs.org/completion/selectrum/projectile.png

| Keybind              | Description                         |
|----------------------+-------------------------------------|
| =SPC p f=, =SPC SPC= | Jump to file in project             |
| =SPC f f=, =SPC .=   | Jump to file from current directory |
| =SPC s i=            | Jump to symbol in file              |

** Project search & replace
This module provides interactive text search and replace using ripgrep.

| Keybind   | Description              |
|-----------+--------------------------|
| =SPC s p= | Search project           |
| =SPC s P= | Search another project   |
| =SPC s d= | Search this directory    |
| =SPC s D= | Search another directory |

Prefixing these keys with the universal argument (=SPC u= for evil users; =C-u=
otherwise) changes the behavior of these commands, instructing the underlying
search engine to include ignored files.

This module also provides Ex Commands for evil users:

| Ex command             | Description                                                      |
|------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~:pg[rep][!] [QUERY]~  | Search project (if ~!~, include hidden files)                    |
| ~:pg[rep]d[!] [QUERY]~ | Search from current directory (if ~!~, don't search recursively) |

The optional `!` is equivalent to the universal argument for the previous
commands.

-----

These keybindings are available while a search is active:

| Keybind   | Description                                   |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-o= | Open a buffer with your search results        |
| =C-c C-e= | Open a writable buffer of your search results |
| =C-SPC=   | Preview the current candidate                 |
| =C-RET=   | Open the selected candidate in other-window   |

Changes to the resulting wgrep buffer (opened by =C-c C-e=) can be committed
with =C-c C-c= and aborted with =C-c C-k= (alternatively =ZZ= and =ZQ=, for evil
users).

** TODO In-buffer searching
The =swiper= package provides an interactive buffer search powered by ivy. It
can be invoked with:

+ =SPC s s= (~swiper-isearch~)
+ =SPC s S= (~swiper-isearch-thing-at-point~)
+ =SPC s b= (~consult-line~)
+ ~:sw[iper] [QUERY]~

https://assets.doomemacs.org/completion/selectrum/buffer-search.png

A wgrep buffer can be opened from swiper with =C-c C-e=.
