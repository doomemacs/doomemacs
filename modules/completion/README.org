Vertico is Doom's default and comes highly recommended of the four. It is the
fastest, best integrated in Doom's ecosystem, and its module is the most
actively maintained of the four. It also has the cleanest codebase and ties into
native functionality already existing in Emacs, rather than reinventing the
wheel.
