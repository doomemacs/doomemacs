      Doom pins its packages to certain commits to avoid breaking updates and to help its maintainer keep up with changes. These pins are updated (bumped) frequently, usually every other week, but some may warrant an early bump, due to critical bug fixes or to adapt to external events.

      Use this form to let us know about these packages. Alternatively, [file a bump PR](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/how2bump).

      Recent changes to X have fixed several open issues in Y and Z, but have broken A and B in Doom.
