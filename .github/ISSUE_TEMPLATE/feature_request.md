**Describe the feature**
Summarize your suggestion or request.

Include why it would be helpful and what type of user it would benefit most.

If this feature is implemented in another editor or Emacs distro, please include
screenshots or screencasts of it. If possible, include the names of the relevant
commands and not just the keybinds to invoke them. Links to their implementation
in source code would tremendously speed up processing of this request.
