      > Before you fill out this bug report, please be aware of the following:
      >
      > - This is not the place for feature requests, general user support, PSAs, or discussions/RFCs. Those belong on [our Github discussion board](https://doomemacs.org/discuss) or [our Discord server](https://doomemacs.org/discord) — whichever you prefer.
      > - Make sure your issue hasn't already been reported or addressed: search the issue tracker, [documentation](https://docs.doomemacs.org), [FAQ](https://docs.doomemacs.org/-/faq), [discussion board](https://doomemacs.org/discuss), and [Google](https://google.com).
      > - Read [the debugging guide](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/55) for ways to extract more information from your issue.
      > - Include [backtraces](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/85) for any error messages.
      >
      > Bug reports that are unactionable, vague, or too broad (or are otherwise unhelpful to posterity) **will be closed and queued for deletion**, with notice. Please understand that we get *many* false positives and open-ended bug reports that we lack the manpower to investigate at length. Keeping them around only pollutes search engines indices and makes it harder to find and follow legitimate issues.

      - Any recent errors/warnings in the \*Messages\* buffer (`C-h e` to open it).
      - Better explanations than "X does not work".
      - Any attempts you made to resolve the issue yourself, and their result.
      - Screenshots or screencasts, if possible.
      - Please disclose what parts are written by AI.

      **Please format code and large text dumps with [code fences](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) or use [pastebin](https://pastebin.com) (or similar).**

      When I do X, it should do Y, but it does Z instead, which throws an error. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
        apply(#<subr funcall-interactively> (pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop")))
        funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
      ```
