      > Before you fill out this bug report, please be aware of the following:
      >
      > - This is not the place for feature requests, general user support, PSAs, or discussions/RFCs. Those belong on [our Github discussion board](https://doomemacs.org/discuss) or [our Discord server](https://doomemacs.org/discord) — whichever you prefer.
      > - Make sure your issue hasn't already been reported or addressed: search the issue tracker, [documentation](https://docs.doomemacs.org), [FAQ](https://docs.doomemacs.org/-/faq), [discussion board](https://doomemacs.org/discuss), and [Google](https://google.com).
      > - Read [the debugging guide](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/55) for ways to extract more information from your issue.
      > - Include [backtraces](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/85) for any reported error messages.
      >
      > Bug reports that are unactionable, vague, or too broad (or are otherwise unhelpful to posterity) **will be closed and queued for deletion**. Please understand that Emacs' complexity produces *many* false positives and open-ended bug reports that we lack the manpower to investigate at length, and keeping them around only pollutes search engines indices and makes it harder for users and maintainers to follow legitimate issues.

    label: Describe your issue
    description: |
      Please try to include as much information as possible. Such as:

      - **A [backtrace](https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/85) for any error messages.**
      - Any recent errors/warnings in the \*Messages\* buffer (`C-h e` to open it).
      - Better explanations than "X does not work".
      - Any attempts you made to resolve the issue yourself, and their result.
      - Screenshots or screencasts, if possible.

      **Take the time to properly format code and text dumps with [code fences](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) or use a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com) (or similar) service.**

      When I do X, it should do Y, but it does Z instead, which throws an error. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
        apply(#<subr funcall-interactively> (pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop")))
        funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
      ```
