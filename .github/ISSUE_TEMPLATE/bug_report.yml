      **Before you proceed, please ensure your issue:**

      - Wasn't already reported on [our issue tracker](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues) or [Discourse](https://discourse.doomemacs.org),
      - Hasn't been covered by [our FAQ](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/master/docs/faq.org),
      - Can be reproduced on the **latest commit** of Doom,
      - Is reproducible on Emacs 27 or 28, _(Emacs 29 is not supported!)_
      - Is reproducible in [vanilla Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org#testing-in-dooms-sandbox) (i.e. with your private config disabled),
      - Is well-researched using [our troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org#troubleshoot).
      - Has not been reported upstream (e.g. in the repos of any involved packages).

      - Screenshots and gifs are a big help!
      - Check the \*Messages\* buffer for errors and/or warnings (press `C-h e` to view this buffer).
      - **Always include backtraces for errors.** ([How to produce a backtrace](https://doomemacs.org/d/how2backtrace))
      - **Use [code fences](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) for code, logs, or text dumps!** Or use pastebin.com!
      - Be specific! Phrases like "X does not work" or "X stopped working" are unacceptable.

      When I do X, Z happened. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
        apply(#<subr funcall-interactively> (pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop")))
        funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
      ```

      I tried setting X to Y, then I tried Z. Here's what else I tried...

      Please take a moment to ensure your issue (and it's title) is **well-researched, descriptive, and specific**, otherwise, you risk it being significantly delayed or automatically closed.

      Emacs' complexity produces many false positive and vague bug reports, so issues that aren't **actionable**, **reproducible in vanilla Doom**, or able to be investigated in a **reasonable amount of time** will be closed. If you think your issue might fall into these categories, please bring it up on [our Discord](https://doomemacs.org/discord) or [Discourse](https://discourse.doomemacs.org) instead.

      :heart: **Thank you for taking the time to file this bug report!**
