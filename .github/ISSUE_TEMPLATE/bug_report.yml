      > [!WARNING]
      > Please do not post feature requests or general user support here. Those belong on [our Github discussion board](https://doomemacs.org/discuss) or [our Discord server](https://doomemacs.org/discord) instead!

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Keep in mind that issues that are unactionable, vague, and/or cannot be reproduced in a reasonable amount of time (or is otherwise unhelpful to posterity) **will be closed and eventually deleted**. Please understand that issues (however trivial) take a lot of time to process and address, and Emacs' complexity produces *many* false positives that pollute our issue tracker, making it harder for users, contributors, and maintainers to find or track issues relevant to them.
      >
      > If you suspect your issue might not make the cut, post them to [the issues category of our Github Discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/doomemacs/discussions/categories/issues) instead.

    label: Describe your issue
    description: |
      Please try to include as much information as possible. Such as:

      - A [backtrace](https://doomemacs.org/d/how2backtrace) for any error messages.
      - Any recent errors/warnings in the \*Messages\* buffer (`C-h e` to open it).
      - Better explanations than "X does not work".
      - Any attempts you made to resolve the issue yourself, and their result.
      - Screenshots or screencasts, if possible.

      **Please take the time to properly format code and text dumps with [code fences](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks), or use a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com) (or similar) service.**

      When I do X, it should do Y, but it does Z instead, which throws an error. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
        apply(#<subr funcall-interactively> (pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop")))
        funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
      ```
