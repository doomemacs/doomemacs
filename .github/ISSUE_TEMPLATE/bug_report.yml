      **Before you fill out this bug report,** please ensure that you've exhausted all other options. Emacs' complexity tends to swamp us with false positive and vague issues. We desperately need your help to meet us halfway by following this checklist:

          I have searched the [issue

          [Discourse](https://discourse.doomemacs.org), and

          I have read "[How to Debug
          Issues](https://doomemacs.org/d/how2debug)", and will use it to
          provide as much information about this issue as possible.

          The issue can be reproduced on the **latest** available commit of
          Doom.

          The issue can be reproduced on a stable release of Emacs, such as 27,
          28, or 29. *(Unstable versions end in .50, .60, or .9x)*

      A concise description of what you're experiencing. Try to include:

      - A [backtrace](https://doomemacs.org/d/how2backtrace) for **each** error message.
      - Any recent errors/warnings in the \*Messages\* buffer (`C-h e` to open it).
      - Screenshots and gifs.
      - Descriptions that are more helpful than "X does not work" or similar.
      - Any attempts you made to resolve the issue yourself, and their result.
    placeholder: |
      When I do X, it does Z instead, which throws an error. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
        apply(#<subr funcall-interactively> (pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop")))
        funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))

      Please take the time to ensure that your report is well-formatted and formulated, and all error messages include [a backtrace](https://doomemacs.org/d/how2backtrace). Issues that are **unactionable**, **vague**, and/or **inadequately researched** (or otherwise unhelpful to posterity) will see heavy delays or be automatically closed (possibly deleted).

      If you aren't sure that it makes the cut, submit it to [our Discord](https://doomemacs.org/discord) or [Discourse](https://discourse.doomemacs.org) instead.

      :heart: **Thank you for taking the time to file this bug report!**
