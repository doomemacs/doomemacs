      **Before you proceed...**

      We depend on you to ensure your issue hasn't already been addressed, isn't covered by documentation, and isn't caused by personal configuration. To help us rule out these possibilities please follow these guidelines:

      + [ ] Search [the FAQ](https://git.doomemacs.org/docs/faq.org) and [the documentation](https://git.doomemacs.org/docs/getting_started.org) for solutions.
      + [ ] Search [the issue tracker](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues) for similar issues (the closed issues too).
      + [ ] Search [the Discourse](https://discourse.doomemacs.org) for any errors and solutions.
      + [ ] Ensure the issue can be reproduced on [the latest commit](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/commit) of Doom Emacs.
      + [ ] Consult [our troubleshooting](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#troubleshoot) on techniques to get more information and, possibly, solve the issue yourself.

      When I do X, Z happened. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))

      Before you go, please make sure your report's title is descriptive and specific. Avoid phrases like "X doesn't work" or "X stopped working". Error messages are best, but failing that, try to describe what "working" means to you.

      **Thank you for taking the time to fill out a bug report!**
