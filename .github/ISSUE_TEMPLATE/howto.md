**What I want to achieve**
Summarize what you are trying to do.

Follow up with an expanded explanation, if necessary. A few suggestions of what
you could include are:

- Code or steps you've tried that did not yield the results you wanted,
- Screenshots/casts of similar features in another editor or elsewhere,
- Additional material or links to resources that could help clarify what you are
  trying to do.
- A link to your private config, if it is available publicly.
- The names of commands available in other Emacs distros (rather than just the
  keybinds that invoke them).


**System information**

Include the output of `M-x doom/info` or `~/.emacs.d/bin/doom info` here.
