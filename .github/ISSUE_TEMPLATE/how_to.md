**What I want to achieve**
Start with a brief 1 or 2 sentence summary of what you're trying to achieve.

Follow up with an expanded explanation, if necessary. A few suggestions of what
you could include are:
- Code or steps you've tried that did not yield the results you wanted.
- Screenshots/casts of a proposed workflow in another editor or Emacs distro,
- Additional material or links to resources that could help clarify what you are
  trying to do.
- A link to your private config, if available.
- The names of commands available in other Emacs distros (rather than just the
  keybinds that invoke them).


**System information**
<details><pre>
Include the output of `M-x doom/info` or `~/.emacs.d/bin/doom info` here.
