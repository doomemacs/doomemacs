;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs package management is opinionated, and so is Doom. Doom uses `straight'
;; to create a declarative, lazy-loaded, and (nominally) reproducible package
;; management system. We use `straight' over `package' because the latter is
;; tempermental. ELPA sources suffer downtime occasionally and often fail to
;; build packages when GNU Tar is unavailable (e.g. MacOS users start with BSD
;; tar). Known gnutls errors plague the current stable release of Emacs (26.x)
;; which bork TLS handshakes with ELPA repos (mainly gnu.elpa.org). See
;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=3434.
;;
;; What's worse, you can only get the latest version of packages through ELPA.
;; In an ecosystem that is constantly changing, this is more frustrating than
;; convenient. Straight (and Doom) can do rolling release, but it is opt-in.
;;
;; Interacting with this package management system is done through Doom's
;; bin/doom script. Find out more about it by running 'doom help' (I highly
;; recommend you add the script to your PATH). Here are some highlights:
;;
;; - `doom install`: a wizard that guides you through setting up Doom and your
;;   private config for the first time.
;; - `doom sync`: your go-to command for making sure Doom is in optimal
;;   condition. It ensures all unneeded packages are removed, all needed ones
;;   are installed, and all metadata associated with them is generated.
;; - `doom upgrade`: upgrades Doom Emacs and your packages to the latest
;;   versions. There's also 'bin/doom sync -u' for updating only your packages.
;;
;; How this works is: the system reads packages.el files located in each
;; activated module, your private config (`doom-user-dir'), and one in
;; `doom-core-dir'. These contain `package!' declarations that tell DOOM what
;; packages to install and where from.
;;
;; All that said, you can still use package.el's commands, but 'doom sync' will
;; purge ELPA packages.

;;   hooks to `emacs-lisp-mode-hook' in their autoloads, and once triggered,
;;   they will try to load their dependencies (like dash or pkg-info), causing
