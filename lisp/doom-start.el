;; because it's inexpensive in non-PGTK builds. Lowering the timeout from the

;;; Disable UI elements early

;;   more, the menu bar exposes functionality that Doom doesn't endorse or
;;   police. Perhaps one day Doom will support these, but today is not that day.
;;   By disabling them early, we save Emacs some time.

;; HACK: I intentionally avoid calling `menu-bar-mode', `tool-bar-mode', and
;;   `scroll-bar-mode' because their manipulation of frame parameters can
;;   trigger/queue a superfluous (and expensive, depending on the window system)
;;   frame redraw at startup. The variables must be set to `nil' as well so
;;   users don't have to call the functions twice to re-enable them.

;; HACK: The menu-bar needs special treatment on MacOS. On Linux and Windows
;;   (and TTY frames in MacOS), the menu-bar takes up valuable in-frame real
;;   estate -- so we disable it -- but on MacOS (GUI frames only) the menu bar
;;   lives outside of the frame, on the MacOS menu bar, which is acceptable, but
;;   disabling Emacs' menu-bar also makes MacOS treat Emacs GUI frames like
;;   non-application windows (e.g. it won't capture focus on activation, among
;;   other things), so the menu-bar should be preserved there.
(when doom--system-macos-p
  ;; NOTE: Don't try to undo the hack below, as it may change without warning.
  ;;   Instead, toggle `menu-bar-mode' (or put it on a hook) as normal. This

;;; Encodings
;; Contrary to what many Emacs users have in their configs, you don't need more
;; than this to make UTF-8 the default coding system:
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
;; ...but `set-language-environment' also sets `default-input-method', which is
;; a step too opinionated.
