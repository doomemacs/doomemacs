;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs package management is opinionated, and so is Doom. Doom uses `straight'
;; to create a declarative, lazy-loaded, and (nominally) reproducible package
;; management system. We use `straight' over `package' because the latter is
;; tempermental. ELPA sources suffer downtime occasionally and often fail to
;; build packages when GNU Tar is unavailable (e.g. MacOS users start with BSD
;; tar). Known gnutls errors plague the current stable release of Emacs (26.x)
;; which bork TLS handshakes with ELPA repos (mainly gnu.elpa.org). See
;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=3434.
;;
;; What's worse, you can only get the latest version of packages through ELPA.
;; In an ecosystem that is constantly changing, this is more frustrating than
;; convenient. Straight (and Doom) can do rolling release, but it is opt-in.
;;
;; Interacting with this package management system is done through Doom's
;; bin/doom script. Find out more about it by running 'doom help' (I highly
;; recommend you add the script to your PATH). Here are some highlights:
;;
;; - `doom install`: a wizard that guides you through setting up Doom and your
;;   private config for the first time.
;; - `doom sync`: your go-to command for making sure Doom is in optimal
;;   condition. It ensures all unneeded packages are removed, all needed ones
;;   are installed, and all metadata associated with them is generated.
;; - `doom upgrade`: upgrades Doom Emacs and your packages to the latest
;;   versions. There's also 'bin/doom sync -u' for updating only your packages.
;;
;; How this works is: the system reads packages.el files located in each
;; activated module, your private config (`doom-user-dir'), and one in
;; `doom-core-dir'. These contain `package!' declarations that tell DOOM what
;; packages to install and where from.
;;
;; All that said, you can still use package.el's commands, but 'doom sync' will
;; purge ELPA packages.
;;
;;; Code:

(defvar doom-packages ()
  "A list of enabled packages. Each element is a sublist, whose CAR is the
package's name as a symbol, and whose CDR is the plist supplied to its
`package!' declaration. Set by `doom-initialize-packages'.")

(defvar doom-disabled-packages ()
  "A list of packages that should be ignored by `use-package!' and `after!'.")

(defvar doom-packages-file "packages"
  "The basename of packages file for modules.

Package files are read whenever Doom's package manager wants a manifest of all
desired packages. They are rarely read in interactive sessions (unless the user
uses a straight or package.el command directly).")

(cl-defmacro package!

  "Declares a package and how to install it (if applicable).

This macro is declarative and does not load nor install packages. It is used to
populate `doom-packages' with metadata about the packages Doom needs to keep
track of.

Only use this macro in a module's packages.el file.

Accepts the following properties:

 :type core|local|built-in|virtual
   Specifies what kind of package this is. Can be a symbol or a list thereof.
     `core' = this is a protected package and cannot be disabled!
     `local' = this package is being modified in-place. This package's repo is
       unshallowed and will be skipped when you update packages.
     `built-in' = this package is already built-in (otherwise, will be
       installed)
     `virtual' = this package is not tracked by Doom's package manager. It won't
       be installed or uninstalled. Use this to pin 2nd order dependencies.
 :recipe RECIPE
   Specifies a straight.el recipe to allow you to acquire packages from external
   sources. See https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el#the-recipe-format
   for details on this recipe.
 :disable BOOL
   Do not install or update this package AND disable all of its `use-package!'
   and `after!' blocks.
 :ignore FORM
   Do not install this package.
 :pin STR|nil
   Pin this package to commit hash STR. Setting this to nil will unpin this
   package if previously pinned.
 :built-in BOOL|'prefer
   Same as :ignore if the package is a built-in Emacs package. This is more to
   inform help commands like `doom/help-packages' that this is a built-in
   package. If set to 'prefer, the package will not be installed if it is
   already provided by Emacs.

Returns t if package is successfully registered, and nil if it was disabled
elsewhere."
