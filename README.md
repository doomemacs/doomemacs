What is Doom Emacs
==================

It is a story as old as time. A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic
vimmer -- envious of the features of modern text editors -- spirals into despair
before succumbing to the [dark side][url:evil-mode]. This is his config.

Doom is a configuration for [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). It
can be used as framework for your own configuration, or as a resource for fellow
Emacs enthusiasts who want to learn more about our favorite OS.

Doom's mantras
--------------
- **Gotta go fast.** Startup and runtime speed are priorities; many expensive,
  heavy-handed packages have been modified to allow lazy loading or exploit
  caching.
- **Close to metal.** There's less between you and vanilla Emacs, by design;
  that means less to grok. Modules should be syntactically sweet and backend
  logic explicit and abstraction-light.
- **Assembly required.** Doom trusts you, for better or worse. It inherits your
  shell configuration, warts et all. If your system is misconfigured, Doom is
  misconfigured.
- **Opinionated, but not stubborn.** Doom Emacs is a bundle of reasonable
  defaults and curated opinions, catered particularly to vimmers, but that's no
  reason you should be stuck with it. Use as little or as much of Doom as you
  like. Use it as a complete Emacs distribution, a baseline for your own, or
  anywhere in between.

Feature Highlights
------------------
- A fabulous, minimalistic interface and theme inspired by modern editors
  (particularly Atom and sublime text).
- A modular architecture for your Emacs configuration with sane defaults.
- A declarative [package management system][doom:packages] managed from the
  command line, which allows you to install packages from anywhere.
- A [popup management system][doom:popups] with customizable rules to dictate
  how temporary/disposable buffers are displayed.
- A vim-centric (and optional) experience with [evil-mode][url:evil-mode],
  including ports of several popular vim plugins, <kbd>C-x</kbd> omnicompletion
  and a slew of [custom ex commands][doom:commands].
- A Spacemacs-esque [keybinding scheme][doom:bindings], centered around leader
  and localleader prefix keys (<kbd>SPC</kbd> and <kbd>SPC</kbd><kbd>m</kbd>, by
  default).
- Indentation detection and [editorconfig][url:editorconfig] integration. Let
  someone else argue about tabs vs ___***spaces***___.
- Code completion for many languages, powered by
  [company-mode][url:company-mode] (some may have external dependencies).
- Project-awareness powered by [projectile][url:projectile], with tools and an
  API to navigate and manage projects, as well as project/framework-specific
  minor modes and snippets libraries (and the ability to define your own).
- Project search (and replace) utilities, powered by
  [the_silver_searcher][url:the_silver_searcher], [ripgrep][url:ripgrep], git-grep and
  [wgrep][url:wgrep], with integration for [ivy][url:ivy] (the default) and
  [helm][url:helm].
- Isolated and persistent workspaces powered by [persp-mode][url:persp-mode].
  Also substitutes as vim tabs.
- Inline/live code evaluation (using [quickrun][url:quickrun]), with REPL
  support for a variety of languages.
- A jump-to-definition/references implementation for all languages that tries to
  "just work," resorting to mode-specific functionality, before falling back on
  [dump-jump][url:dump-jump].


Troubleshooting
===============

Encountered strange behavior or an error? Here are some things to try before you
shoot off that bug report:

- Run `bin/doom refresh`. This ensures Doom is properly set up and its autoloads
  files are up-to-date.
- If you have byte-compiled your config (with `bin/doom compile`), see if
  `bin/doom clean` makes the issue go away. Never debug issues with a
  byte-compiled config, it will make your job harder.
- Run `bin/doom doctor` to detect common issues in your development environment.
- Search Doom's issue tracker for mention of any error messages you've received.
- [Visit our FAQ][docs:faq] to see if your issue is listed.

If all else fails, [file that bug report][github:new-issue]! Please include the
behavior you've observed, the behavior you expected, and any error messages
or warnings logged to the \*Messages\* buffer (can be opened with <kbd>SPC h
e</kbd> or `M-x view-echo-area-messages`).

It's a great help if you included a backtrace with errors, i.e. `M-x
toggle-debug-on-error` then recreating the error(s).

We've also got [a Discord server][url:discord]. Hop on! We can help!


Contributing
============

Doom (and my Emacs work in general) is a labor of love and incurable madness,
done on my spare time. If you'd like to support my work, I welcome
contributions:

- I love pull requests and bug reports. Check out the [Contributing
  Guidelines][docs:contributing] to find out how you can help out.
- I welcome Elisp pointers! Don't hesitate to [tell me my Elisp-fu
  sucks][github:new-issue] (but please tell me why).
- Hop on [our Discord server][url:discord] and say hi! Help others out, hang out
  or talk to me about Emacs, or gamedev, or programming, machine learning,
  physics, pixel art, anime, gaming -- anything you like. Nourish this lonely
  soul!
- If you'd like to support my work financially, consider buying me a drink
  through [liberapay][url:liberapay] or [paypal][url:paypal]. Donations are a
  great help. My work here contends with studies, ventures in indie gamedev, and
  my freelance work.
