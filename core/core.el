The bootstrap process ensures that everything Doom needs to run is set up;
essential directories exist, core packages are installed, `doom-autoloads-file'
is loaded (failing if it isn't), that all the needed hooks are in place, and
that `core-packages' will load when `package' or `straight' is used.

The overall load order of Doom is as follows:

  ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  ~/.emacs.d/core/core.el
  ~/.doom.d/init.el
  Module init.el files
  `doom-before-init-modules-hook'
  Module config.el files

  `doom-after-init-modules-hook' (alias for `after-init-hook')
  `emacs-startup-hook'
  `doom-init-ui-hook'
