Before you doom yourself, there are a few things you should know:

1. If you use GUI Emacs, run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so you don't get
   weird symbols all over the place.

2. Whenever you edit ~/.doom.d/init.el or modify modules, run:

     bin/doom refresh

   This will ensure all needed packages are installed, all orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads files are up to date. This is important! If you
   forget to do this you will get errors!

3. If something inexplicably goes wrong, it's a good idea to try:

     bin/doom doctor

   This will diagnose common issues with your environment and setup, and may
   give you clues about what is wrong.

4. To update doom, run

     bin/doom upgrade

   Doing it any other way will require you run `bin/doom refresh` otherwise,

5. Check out `bin/doom help` to see what else it can do (it is recommended you
   add ~/.emacs.d/bin to your PATH).

Have fun!
