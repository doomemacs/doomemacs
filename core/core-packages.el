;; Emacs package management is opinionated, and so am I. I've bound together
;; `use-package', `quelpa' and package.el to create my own, rolling-release,
;; lazily-loaded package management system for Emacs.
;;
;; The three key commands are:
;;
;; + `bin/doom install`: Installs packages that are wanted, but not installed.
;; + `bin/doom update`: Updates packages that are out-of-date.
;; + `bin/doom autoremove`: Uninstalls packages that are no longer needed.
;;
;; This system reads packages.el files located in each activated module (and one
;; in `doom-core-dir'). These contain `package!' blocks that tell DOOM what
;; plugins to install and where from.
;;
;; Why all the trouble? Because:
;; 1. *Scriptability:* I live in the command line. I want a shell-scriptable
;;    interface for updating and installing Emacs packages.
;; 2. *Reach:* I want packages from sources other than ELPA (like github or
;;    gitlab). Some plugins are out-of-date through official channels, have
;;    changed hands, have a superior fork, or simply aren't available in ELPA
;;    repos.
;; 3. *Performance:* The package management system isn't loaded until you use
;;    the package management API. Not having to initialize package.el or quelpa
;;    (and check that your packages are installed) every time you start up (or
;;    load a package) speeds things up a great deal.
;; 4. *Separation of concerns:* It's more organized and reduces cognitive load
;;    to separate configuring of packages and installing/updating them.
;;
;; You should be able to use package.el commands without any conflicts.
;;
;; See core/autoload/packages.el for more functions.

Accepts the following properties:

 :recipe RECIPE
   Takes a MELPA-style recipe (see `quelpa-recipe' in `quelpa' for an example);
   for packages to be installed from external sources.
 :pin ARCHIVE-NAME
   Instructs ELPA to only look for this package in ARCHIVE-NAME. e.g. \"org\".
   Ignored if RECIPE is present.
 :disable BOOL
   Do not install or update this package AND disable all of its `def-package!'
   blocks.
 :ignore FORM
   Do not install this package.
 :freeze FORM
   Do not update this package if FORM is non-nil.
 :built-in BOOL
   Same as :ignore if the package is a built-in Emacs package.

Returns t if package is successfully registered, and nil if it was disabled
