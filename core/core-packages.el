;; Emacs package management is opinionated, and so is Doom. Doom uses `straight'
;; to create a declarative, lazy-loaded and optionally rolling-release package
;; management system. We use `straight' over `package' because the latter is
;; tempermental. ELPA sources suffer downtime occasionally, and often fail at
;; building some packages when GNU Tar is unavailable (e.g. MacOS users start
;; with BSD tar). There are also known gnutls errors in the current stable
;; release of Emacs (26.x) which bork TLS handshakes with ELPA repos (mainly
;; gnu.elpa.org). See https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=3434.
;;
;; What's worse, you can only get the latest version of packages through ELPA.
;; In an ecosystem that is constantly changing, this is more frustrating than
;; convenient. Straight (and Doom) can do rolling release, but it is optional
;; (and will eventually be opt-in).
;;
;; ANyhow, interacting with this package management system is done through the
;; bin/doom script included with Doom Emacs. You'll find more about it by
;; running 'doom help' (I highly recommend you add it to your PATH), but here
;; are the highlights:
;;
;; + `bin/doom install`: a wizard that guides you through setting up Doom and
;;   your private config for the first time.
;; + `bin/doom sync`: your go-to command for making sure Doom is in optimal
;;   condition. It ensures all unneeded packages are removed, all needed ones
;;   are installed, and all metadata associated with them is generated.
;; + `bin/doom upgrade`: upgrades Doom Emacs and your packages to the latest
;;   versions. There's also 'bin/doom update' for updating only your packages.
;;
;; How this works is: the system reads packages.el files located in each
;; activated module, your private directory (`doom-private-dir'), and one in
;; `doom-core-dir'. These contain `package!' declarations that tell DOOM what
;; plugins to install and where from.
;;
;; All that said, you can still use package.el's commands, but 'bin/doom
;; refresh' will purge ELPA packages.

 :ignore FORM
   Do not install this package.
 :pin STR|nil
   Pin this package to commit hash STR. Setting this to nil will unpin this
   package if previously pinned.
 :built-in BOOL|'prefer
   Same as :ignore if the package is a built-in Emacs package. This is more to
   inform help commands like `doom/help-packages' that this is a built-in
