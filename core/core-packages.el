;; Emacs package management is opinionated, and so is Doom. Doom uses `straight'
;; to create a declarative, lazy-loaded and (nominally) reproducible package
;; management system. We use `straight' over `package' because the latter is
;; tempermental. ELPA sources suffer downtime occasionally and often fail to
;; build packages when GNU Tar is unavailable (e.g. MacOS users start with BSD
;; tar). Known gnutls errors plague the current stable release of Emacs (26.x)
;; which bork TLS handshakes with ELPA repos (mainly gnu.elpa.org). See
;; https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=3434.
;;
;; What's worse, you can only get the latest version of packages through ELPA.
;; In an ecosystem that is constantly changing, this is more frustrating than
;; convenient. Straight (and Doom) can do rolling release, but it is opt-in.
;;
;; Interacting with this package management system is done through Doom's
;; bin/doom script. Find out more about it by running 'doom help' (I highly
;; recommend you add the script to your PATH). Here are some highlights:
;;
;; + `bin/doom install`: a wizard that guides you through setting up Doom and
;;   your private config for the first time.
;; + `bin/doom sync`: your go-to command for making sure Doom is in optimal
;;   condition. It ensures all unneeded packages are removed, all needed ones
;;   are installed, and all metadata associated with them is generated.
;; + `bin/doom upgrade`: upgrades Doom Emacs and your packages to the latest
;;   versions. There's also 'bin/doom update' for updating only your packages.
;;
;; How this works is: the system reads packages.el files located in each
;; activated module, your private directory (`doom-private-dir'), and one in
;; `doom-core-dir'. These contain `package!' declarations that tell DOOM what
;; plugins to install and where from.
;;
;; All that said, you can still use package.el's commands, but 'bin/doom sync'
;; will purge ELPA packages.

 :recipe RECIPE
   Specifies a straight.el recipe to allow you to acquire packages from external
   sources. See https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format for
   details on this recipe.
 :disable BOOL
   Do not install or update this package AND disable all of its `use-package!'
   and `after!' blocks.
 :ignore FORM
   Do not install this package.
 :pin STR|nil
   Pin this package to commit hash STR. Setting this to nil will unpin this
   package if previously pinned.
 :built-in BOOL|'prefer
   Same as :ignore if the package is a built-in Emacs package. This is more to
   inform help commands like `doom/help-packages' that this is a built-in
   package. If set to 'prefer, the package will not be installed if it is
   already provided by Emacs.
 :shadow PACKAGE
   Informs Doom that this package is shadowing a built-in PACKAGE; the original
   package will be removed from `load-path' to mitigate conflicts, and this new
   package will satisfy any dependencies on PACKAGE in the future.

Returns t if package is successfully registered, and nil if it was disabled
elsewhere."

This unpins packages, so that 'doom upgrade' downloads their latest version. It

+ To unpin all packages in a group of modules: (unpin! :lang :tools ...)
+ To unpin packages in individual modules:
    (unpin! (:lang python javascript) (:tools docker))

Or any combination of the above.
