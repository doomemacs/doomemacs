;;; core/core-packages.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Emacs package management is opinionated, and so am I. I've bound together
;; `use-package', `quelpa' and package.el to create my own, rolling-release,
;; lazily-loaded package management system for Emacs.
;;
;; The three key commands are:
;;
;; + `bin/doom install`: Installs packages that are wanted, but not installed.
;; + `bin/doom update`: Updates packages that are out-of-date.
;; + `bin/doom autoremove`: Uninstalls packages that are no longer needed.
;;
;; This system reads packages.el files located in each activated module (and one
;; in `doom-core-dir'). These contain `package!' blocks that tell DOOM what
;; plugins to install and where from.
;;
;; Why all the trouble? Because:
;; 1. Scriptability: I live in the command line. I want a programmable
;;    alternative to `list-packages' for updating and installing packages.
;; 2. Flexibility: I want packages from sources other than ELPA. Primarily
;;    github, because certain plugins are out-of-date through official channels,
;;    have changed hands, have a superior fork, or simply aren't in any ELPA
;;    repo.
;; 3. Stability: I used Cask before this. It would error out with cyrptic errors
;;    depending on the version of Emacs I used and the alignment of the planets.
;;    No more.
;; 4. Performance: A minor point, but this system is lazy-loaded (more so if you
;;    byte-compile). Not having to initialize package.el (or check that your
;;    packages are installed) every time you start up Emacs affords us precious
;;    seconds.
;; 5. Simplicity: No Cask, no external dependencies (unless you count make),
;;    just Emacs. Arguably, my config is still over-complicated, but shhh, it's
;;    fine. Everything is fine.
;;
;; You should be able to use package.el commands without any conflicts.
;;
;; See core/autoload/packages.el for more functions.
