  "Returns a list of files/directories in PATH-OR-PATHS (one string path or a
list of them).

FILTER is a function or symbol that takes one argument (the path). If it returns
non-nil, the entry will be excluded.

MAP is a function or symbol which will be used to transform each entry in the
results.

TYPE determines what kind of path will be included in the results. This can be t
(files and folders), 'files or 'dirs.

By default, this function returns paths relative to PATH-OR-PATHS if it is a
single path. If it a list of paths, this function returns absolute paths.
Otherwise, by setting RELATIVE-TO to a path, the results will be transformed to
be relative to it.

The search recurses up to DEPTH and no further. DEPTH is an integer.

MATCH is a string regexp. Only entries that match it will be included."
