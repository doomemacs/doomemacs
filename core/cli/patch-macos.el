  "Patches Emacs.app to respect your shell environment.

WARNING: This command is deprecated. Use 'doom env' instead.

A common issue with GUI Emacs on MacOS is that it launches in an environment
independent of your shell configuration, including your PATH and any other
utilities like rbenv, rvm or virtualenv.

This patch fixes this by patching Emacs.app (in /Applications or
~/Applications). It will:

  1. Move Contents/MacOS/Emacs to Contents/MacOS/RunEmacs
  2. And replace Contents/MacOS/Emacs with the following wrapper script:

     #!/user/bin/env bash
     args=\"$@\"
     pwd=\"$(cd \"$(dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\"; pwd -P)\"
     exec \"$SHELL\" -l -c \"$pwd/RunEmacs $args\"

This ensures that Emacs is always aware of your shell environment, regardless of
how it is launched.

It can be undone with the --undo or -u options.

Alternatively, you can install the exec-path-from-shell Emacs plugin, which will
scrape your shell environment remotely, at startup. However, this can be slow
depending on your shell configuration and isn't always reliable.")
