Each function is N-arity and is passed a plist with the following keys:

  :bang
    (Boolean) If `t', the commit is declared to contain a breaking change.
    e.g. 'refactor!: this commit breaks everything'
  :body
    (String) Contains the whole BODY of a commit message, excluding the
    TRAILERS.
  :scopes
    (List<Symbol>) Contains a list of scopes, as symbols. e.g. with
    'feat(org,lsp): so on and so forth', this contains '(org lsp).
  :subject
    (String) Contains the whole first line of a commit message.
  :summary
    (String) Contains the summary following the type and scopes. e.g. In
    'feat(org): fix X, Y, and Z' the summary is 'fix X, Y, and Z.
  :trailers
    (Map<String, String>) Contains an alist of 'KEY: VALUE' trailers, i.e. All
    Fix, Ref, Close, Revert, etc lines with a valid value. This will be empty if
    the formatting of a commit's trailers is invalid.
  :type
    (Symbol) The type of commit this is. E.g. `feat', `fix', `bump', etc.

Each function should call `fail!' or `warn!' one or more times, or `skip!'
(immediately returns). Each of these lexical functions take the same arguments
as `format'.

Note: warnings are not considered failures.")
