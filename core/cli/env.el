function."))
  "Creates or regenerates your envvars file.

The envvars file is created by scraping the current shell environment into
newline-delimited KEY=VALUE pairs. Typically by running '$SHELL -ic env' (or
'$SHELL -c set' on windows). Doom loads this file at startup (if it exists) to
ensure Emacs mirrors your shell environment (particularly to ensure PATH and
SHELL are correctly set).

This is useful in cases where you cannot guarantee that Emacs (or the daemon)
will be launched from the correct environment (e.g. on MacOS or through certain
app launchers on Linux).

This file is automatically regenerated when you run this command or 'doom sync'.
However, 'doom sync' will only regenerate this file if it exists.

Why this over exec-path-from-shell?

  1. `exec-path-from-shell' spawns (at least) one process at startup to scrape
     your shell environment. This can be arbitrarily slow depending on the
     user's shell configuration. A single program (like pyenv or nvm) or config
     framework (like oh-my-zsh) could undo all of Doom's startup optimizations
     in one fell swoop.

  2. `exec-path-from-shell' only scrapes some state from your shell. You have to
     be proactive in order to get it to capture all the envvars relevant to your
     development environment.

     I'd rather it inherit your shell environment /correctly/ (and /completely/)
     or not at all. It frontloads the debugging process rather than hiding it
     until you least want to deal with it."
