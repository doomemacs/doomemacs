* General
** Why is it called Doom?
An homage to idsoftware's classic game, whose open sourced code was my first
exposure to programming.

Also, if you're obsessed enough with a text editor that you write a community
config for it, you're doomed from the get go.

** Does Doom work on Windows?
Windows support is weak and will generally lag behind Linux/MacOS support, so
your mileage will vary. However, many have reported success installing Doom
Emacs on Windows (using WSL, WSL2 or scoop/chocolatey). You'll find install
instructions for Windows in the [[file:getting_started.org::On Windows][Getting Starting guide]].

If you're a Windows user, help us improve our documentation on Windows support!

** Is Doom only for vimmers?
Henrik is a dyed-in-the-wool vimmer with more than a decade of vim muscle
memory. Vim's is the only paradigm he truly knows, so vimmers will always be his
primary audience.

That's not to say Doom won't work without evil, only that it is less polished in
that respect. Our growing non-evil userbase are slowly improving the situation
however. We welcome suggestions and PRs to help accommodate a non-evil workflow.

If you'd still like a go at it, see the [[file:../modules/editor/evil/README.org::Removing%20evil-mode][Removing evil-mode]] section in the
[[file:../modules/editor/evil/README.org][:editor evil]] module's documentation.

** I am a beginner. Can I use Doom?
If you're new to the terminal, to programming, or Emacs and/or vim, Doom (or
Emacs, for that matter) is a rough place to start. Neither Doom nor Emacs are
particularly beginner friendly. That's not to say it's impossible, or that we
won't help you if you ask, but expect a hefty commitment and a bumpy journey.

Remember to check out the [[file:index.org][Documentation]] for a guide to getting started.

** How does Doom compare to Spacemacs?
To paraphrase (and expand upon) a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pa0oq/quickstart_tutorial_for_emacs_newbies_with_doom/dkp1bhd/][reddit answer]] to this question by [[https://github.com/gilbertw1][@gilbertw1]]:

+ *Doom is lighter than Spacemacs.* Doom starts up faster and is better
  optimized, but Spacemacs has more features.
+ *Doom is thinner than Spacemacs.* There are fewer abstractions between you and
  vanilla Emacs, and what abstractions do exist are thin by design. This means
  there's less to understand and it's easier to hack.
+ *Doom is much more opinionated than Spacemacs.* Doom does not strive to be a
  one-size-fits-all, beginner-friendly solution, nor is it configured by
  consensus. It is [mostly] the work of one developer and caters to his
  vim-slanted tastes. Doom's defaults enforce very particular (albeit optional)
  workflows.
+ *Doom lacks manpower.* Bugs stick around longer, documentation is light and
  development is at the mercy of it's single maintainer's schedule, health and
  whims.
+ *Doom is not beginner friendly.* Spacemacs works out of the box. Your mileage
  may vary with Doom; assembly is required! Familiarity with Emacs Lisp (or
  programming in general), git and the command line will go a long way to ease
  you into Doom.
+ *Doom manages its packages outside of Emacs.* Spacemacs installs (and checks
  for packages) on startup or on demand. Doom leaves package management to be
  done externally, through the ~bin/doom~ script. This allows for package
  management to be scripted on the command line and enables a number of startup
  optimizations we wouldn't have otherwise.

** Why such a complicated package management system?
Doom had *five* goals for its package management system:

1. *Scriptability:* package management should be shell-scriptable, so updating
   can be automated.
2. *Reach:* allow users to install packages from sources other than ELPA (like
   github or gitlab), and from specific commits, branches or tags. Some plugins
   are out-of-date through official channels, have changed hands, have a
   superior fork, or aren't available in ELPA repos.
3. *Performance:* lazy-loading the package management system is a tremendous
   boon to start up speed. Initializing package.el and quelpa (and/or checking
   that your packages are installed) every time you start up is expensive.
4. *Organization:* an Emacs configuration grows so quickly, in complexity and
   size. A clear separation of concerns (configuration of packages from their
   installation) is more organized.
5. *Reproducibility:* /This goal hasn't been implemented yet/, but all our work
   up until now is aimed at this goal. Emacs is a tumultuous ecosystem; packages
   break left and right, and we rely on hundreds of them. Eventually, we want
   package versions to be locked to versions of Doom so that Doom installs are
   reproducible.

** How does Doom start up so quickly?
Doom employs a number of techniques to cut down startup time. Here are its most
effective techniques:

*** Avoid garbage collection at startup
The GC can easily double startup time, so we suppress it at startup by turning
up ~gc-cons-threshold~ (and perhaps ~gc-cons-percentage~) temporarily:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum ; 2^61 bytes
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)

;; ... your emacs config here ...
#+END_SRC

However, it is important to reset it eventually (as late as possible). Not doing
so will cause garbage collection freezes during long-term interactive use.
Conversely, a ~gc-cons-threshold~ that is too small will cause stuttering. We
use 16mb as our default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
  (lambda ()
    (setq gc-cons-threshold 16777216 ; 16mb
          gc-cons-percentage 0.1)))
#+END_SRC

It may also be wise to raise ~gc-cons-threshold~ while the minibuffer is active,
so the GC doesn't slow down expensive commands (or completion frameworks, like
helm and ivy). Here is how Doom does it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun doom-defer-garbage-collection-h ()
  (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum))

(defun doom-restore-garbage-collection-h ()
  ;; Defer it so that commands launched immediately after will enjoy the
  ;; benefits.
  (run-at-time
   1 nil (lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold doom-gc-cons-threshold))))

(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'doom-defer-garbage-collection-h)
(add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook #'doom-restore-garbage-collection-h)
#+END_SRC

*** Unset ~file-name-handler-alist~ temporarily
Emacs consults this variable every time a file is read or library loaded, or
when certain functions in the file API are used (like ~expand-file-name~ or
~file-truename~).

They do so to check if a special handler is needed to read it, but none of these
handlers are necessary for the initialization work we do at startup, so it is
generally safe to disable it (temporarily!):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar doom--file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)

;; ... your whole emacs config here ...

;; Then restore it later:
(setq file-name-handler-alist doom--file-name-handler-alist)

;; Alternatively, restore it even later:
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
  (lambda ()
    (setq file-name-handler-alist doom--file-name-handler-alist)))
#+END_SRC

It is important to restore this variable, otherwise you won't be able to use
TRAMP and Emacs will be unable to read compressed/encrypted files.

*** Cut down on ~load-path~ lookups
Each ~load~ and ~require~ call (without an second argument) costs an O(n) lookup
on ~load-path~. The average Doom config has approximately 260 packages including
dependencies, and around 40 built-in packages. That means a minimum of 300
entries in ~load-path~ with a worst case of =n=300= for /each/ package load (but
realistically, =n= will be somewhere between =2= and =20=).

The cost isn't great, but it does add up. There isn't much to do about this,
except be mindful of it where we can:

+ Paths in Doom's autoloads file are replaced with absolute ones, thus incurring
  no lookup cost to lazy load them.
+ The ~load!~ macro is used instead of ~require~ where possible. This builds
  paths with string concatenation (which is baked in at compile time, removing
  most of the associated cost).
+ ~load-path~ is let-bound to a subset of itself where possible (the
  ~doom--initial-load-path~ variable contains the value of ~load-path~ before it
  was touched by Doom).

*** Concatenate package autoloads
When you install a package, a PACKAGE-autoloads.el file is generated. This file
contains a map of autoloaded functions and snippets declared by the package
(that's what those ~;;;###autoload~ comments are for in packages). They tell
Emacs where to find them, when they are eventually called. In your conventional
Emacs config, every single one of these autoloads files are loaded immediately
at startup.

Since you'll commonly have hundreds of packages, loading hundreds of autoloads
file can hurt startup times. We get around this by concatenating these autoloads
files into one giant one (in =~/.emacs.d/.local/autoloads.pkg.el=) when you run
~doom refresh~.

Emacs 27+ will introduce a ~package-quickstart~ feature that will do this for
you -- the =straight= package manager does this for you too -- but Doom Emacs
has its own specialized mechanism for doing this, and has tacked a number of
Doom-specific optimizations on top of it.

*** Lazy load package management system(s)
Initializing package.el or straight.el at startup is expensive. We can save some
time by delaying that initialization until we actually need these libraries (and
only eagerly load them when we're doing package management, e.g. when we run
~doom refresh~).

Among other things, ~doom refresh~ does a lot for us. It generates concatenated
autoloads files; caches expensive variables like caches ~load-path~,
~Info-directory-list~ and ~auto-mode-alist~; and preforms all your package
management activities there -- far away from your interactive sessions.

How exactly Doom accomplishes all this is a little complex, so instead, here is
a boiled-down version you can use in your own configs (for package.el, not
straight.el):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar cache-file "~/.emacs.d/cache/autoloads")

(defun initialize ()
  (unless (load cache-file t t)
    (setq package-activated-list nil)
    (package-initialize)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (cl-pushnew doom-core-dir load-path :test #'string=)
      (dolist (spec package-alist)
        (when-let (desc (cdr spec))
          (let ((file (concat (package--autoloads-file-name desc) ".el")))
            (when (file-readable-p file)
              ;; Ensure that the contents of this autoloads file believes they
              ;; haven't been moved:
              (insert "(let ((load-file-name " (prin1-to-string (abbreviate-file-name file)) "))\n")
              (insert-file-contents file)
              (save-excursion
                ;; Delete forms that modify `load-path' and `auto-mode-alist', we
                ;; will set them once, later.
                (while (re-search-forward "^\\s-*\\((\\(?:add-to-list\\|\\(?:when\\|if\\) (boundp\\)\\s-+'\\(?:load-path\\|auto-mode-alist\\)\\)" nil t)
                  (goto-char (match-beginning 1))
                  (kill-sexp)))
              ;; Remove unnecessary comment lines and (provide ...) forms
              (while (re-search-forward "^\\(?:;;\\(.*\n\\)\\|\n\\|(provide '[^\n]+\\)" nil t)
                (unless (nth 8 (syntax-ppss))
                  (replace-match "" t t)))
              (unless (bolp) (insert "\n"))
              (insert ")\n")))))
      (prin1 `(setq load-path ',load-path
                    auto-mode-alist ',auto-mode-alist
                    Info-directory-list ',Info-directory-list)
             (current-buffer))
      (write-file (concat cache-file ".el"))
      (byte-compile-file cache-file))))

(initialize)
#+END_SRC

You'll need to delete ~cache-files~ any time you install, remove, or update a
new package, however. In that case you could advise ~package-install~ and
~package-delete~ to call ~initialize~ when they succeed. Or, you could make
~initialize~ interactive and call it manually when you determine it's necessary.
Up to you!

Note: package.el is sneaky, and will initialize itself if you're not careful.
*Not on my watch, criminal scum!*

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; in ~/.emacs.d/init.el (or ~/.emacs.d/early-init.el in Emacs 27)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil ; don't auto-initialize!
      ;; don't add that `custom-set-variables' block to my init.el!
      package--init-file-ensured t)
#+END_SRC

*** Lazy load more than everything
~use-package~ can defer your packages. Using it is a no-brainer, but Doom goes a
little further with lazy loading. There are some massive plugins out there. For
many of them, ordinary lazy loading techniques simply don't work. To name a few:

+ The =lang/org= module defers loading babel packages until their src blocks are
  executed. You no longer need ~org-babel-do-load-languages~ in your config.
+ Company and yasnippet are loaded as late as possible (waiting until the user
  opens a non-read-only, file-visiting buffer (that isn't in fundamental-mode)).
+ The =evil-easymotion= package has many keybinds. You'd need to load the
  package for them to all take effect, so instead, =gs= is bound to a command
  that loads the package and then invisibly populates =gs=, then simulates the
  =gs= keypress as though those new keys had always been there.
+ A number of packages are "incrementally" loaded. This is a Doom feature where,
  after a few seconds of idle time post-startup, Doom will load packages
  piecemeal while Emacs. It will quickly abort if it detects input, as to make
  the process as subtle as possible.

  For example, instead of loading =org= (a giant package), it will load these
  dependencies, one at a time, before finally loading =org=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (calendar find-func format-spec org-macs org-compat org-faces org-entities
   org-list org-pcomplete org-src org-footnote org-macro ob org org-agenda
   org-capture)
  #+END_SRC

  This ensures packages load as quickly as possible when you first load an org
  file.

*** +Exploit byte-compilation!+
It used to be that byte-compilation bought a 40-60% improvement in startup
times, because expensive operations (like ~package-initialize~ or
~exec-path-from-shell~) were evaluated at compile time, but Doom has changed.

I've since adopted a pre-cache approach (when running ~doom refresh~), which
brings these startup benefits to uncompiled Emacs. This renders byte-compilation
significantly less beneficial for startup time.

That said, compilation will still benefit Doom's snappiness in general.

Run ~doom compile :core~ to only compile Doom's core files, or ~doom compile~ to
compile the /entire/ config (=~/.emacs.d= and =~/.doom.d=) -- which may take a
while.

*** Use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Lexical-Binding.html][lexical-binding]] everywhere
Add ~;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-~ to the top of your elisp files. This can
break code if you've written it to depend on undeclared dynamic variables, but
I've designed Doom not to.

This buys a small improvement in performance, but every little bit helps. You'll
find more about it in:

+ [[http://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/01/30/]["How to Write Fast(er) Emacs Lisp."]]
+ [[http://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/]["Some Performance Advantages of Lexical Scope."]]

** Why is startup time important? Why not use the daemon?
One of my motivations for a config that starts up fast (aside from the learning
experience) was to shape Emacs into a viable alternative to vim for one-shot
editing in the terminal (without ~-Q~). This also facilitates:

- Running multiple, independent instances of Emacs (e.g. on a per-project basis, or
  for nix-shell users, or to isolate one instance for IRC from an instance for
  writing code, etc).
- Quicker restarting of Emacs, to reload package settings or recover from
  disastrous errors which can leave Emacs in a broken state.
- Faster integration with "edit in Emacs" solutions (like [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]]), and
  the potential to use them without a running daemon.

What's more, I don't like using more tools than I need. We should not need a
second program just to make the first run comfortably.

** How do I use Doom alongside other Emacs configs?
I recommend [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs][Chemacs]]. You can think of it as a bootloader for Emacs. You'll [[file:getting_started.org::*Alongside other Emacs configs (with Chemacs)][find
instructions on how to use it with Doom in the user manual]].

If you only want to try it out without affecting your current config, it is safe
to install Doom anywhere you like. The ~bin/doom~ utility will only address the
config the script is located under.

You'll still need a separate folder for personal configuration (=~/.doom.d= or
=~/.config/doom= by default), but the =-p PATH= flag (or ~DOOMDIR~ environment
variable) will allow you to use a different location:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# First install Doom somewhere
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/fakehome/doom-emacs
# Then create a place to store our private doom configs. The bin/doom script
# recognizes the DOOMDIR environment variable.
export DOOMDIR=~/fakehome/doom-emacs-config
mkdir -p "$DOOMDIR"

# Set up Doom for the first time; this may take a while
cd ~/fakehome/doom-emacs
bin/doom install

# then launch Doom Emacs from this folder with:
bin/doom run
#+END_SRC

#+begin_quote
Warning: the way ~bin/doom run~ starts Doom bypasses many of its startup
optimizations. Treat it as a convenience for testing Doom, rather than a
permanent entry point.
#+end_quote

** Why should I use Doom instead of rolling my own config?
If you care about personalizing the software you use on a daily basis, even half
as much as I do, then you probably need professional help, but you also know it
is time consuming. Emacs out-of-the-box is a barren wasteland with archaic
defaults. Building anything out here and getting a feel for it will take /a lot/
of time. Time that I've already wasted and can never get back.

Time you could otherwise spend attending your daughter's dance recitals, that
baseball game your son's team almost won last Thursday, or answering the court
summons to fight for custody of your kids.

Also, Doom's fast yo.

** What is the meaning behind Doom's naming conventions?
You'll find [[file:contributing.org::*Conventions][an overview of Doom's code conventions]] in the [[file:contributing.org][contributing guide]].

** How can I contribute to/support Doom?
Take a look at the [[file:contributing.org][Contributing guide]].

** What version of Doom am I running?
You'll find the current version displayed in the modeline on the dashboard. It
can also be retrieved using ~M-x doom/version~ (bound to =SPC h d v= by default)
or ~doom info~ on the command line.

* Configuration
** Should I fork Doom to customize it?
No. Not unless you have a good reason for doing so (and you're comfortable with
the git-rebase workflow). Your customization can be relegated to =~/.doom.d/=
(or =~/.config/doom/=) entirely.

If you /must/ modify Doom proper to get something done, it's a code smell.

Visit the [[file:getting_started.org::*Customize][Customize section]] of [[file:getting_started.org][the Getting Started guide]] for details on how to
do this.

** How do I configure Doom Emacs?
Canonically, your private config is kept in =~/.doom.d/= or =~/.config/doom/=.
Doom will prioritize =~/.config/doom=, if it exists. This directory is referred
to as your ~$DOOMDIR~.

Your private config is typically comprised of an =init.el=, =config.el= and
=packages.el= file. Put all your config in =config.el=, install packages by
adding ~package!~ declarations to =packagse.el=, and enable/disable modules in
you ~doom!~ block, which should have been created in your =init.el= when you
first ran ~doom install~.

Check out the [[file:getting_started.org::Customize][Customize section]] in the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting Started]] guide for details.

** How do I enable or disable a Doom module?
You'll find your ~doom!~ block in =~/.doom.d/init.el=. This block contains a
list of modules you want enabled and what order to load them in. Disable modules
by commenting them out with semicolons. To enable them, remove those leading
semicolons:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(doom! :lang
       python     ; this is enabled
       ;;ruby     ; this is disabled
       rust)
#+END_SRC

Remember to run ~bin/doom refresh~ afterwards, on the command line, to sync your
module list with Doom.

You can find a comprehensive list of modules in the [[file:index.org::*Module list][Module Index]].

** How do I install a package from ELPA?
Add a ~package!~ declaration to =~/.doom.d/packages.el= for each package you
want installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(package! winum)
#+END_SRC

Remember to run ~doom refresh~ afterwards to ensure the package is installed.

You'll find more information in the "[[file:getting_started.org::*Installing%20packages][Installing packages]]" section of the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting
Started]] guide.

** How do I install a package from github/another source?
The ~package!~ macro can be passed a MELPA style recipe, allowing you to install
packages from just about anywhere:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(package! evil :recipe (:host github :repo "hlissner/my-evil-fork"))
#+END_SRC

Remember to run ~doom refresh~ every time you modify you package list, to ensure
your packages are set up and installed.

You can find more information about the recipe format [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][in the straight.el package
readme]].

#+begin_quote
If a MELPA recipe exists for the package you are writing a ~package!~
declaration for, you may omit keywords and Doom's package manager will fill them
in with values from its original recipe.
#+end_quote

You'll find more information in the "[[file:getting_started.org::*Installing%20packages%20from%20external%20sources][Installing packages from external sources]]"
section of the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting Started]] guide.

** How do I change where an existing package is installed from?
~package!~ declarations in your private =packages.el= file have precedence over
modules (even your own). Simply add a new one for that package with the new
recipe.

You'll find more information in the "[[file:getting_started.org::*Changing%20a%20built-in%20recipe%20for%20a%20package][Changing a built-in recipe for a package]]"
section of the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting Started]] guide.

** How do I disable a package completely?
With the ~package!~ macro's ~:disable~ property:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; add to DOOMDIR/packages.el
(package! irony :disable t)
#+END_SRC

Remember to run ~doom refresh~ afterwards to ensure that the package is
uninstalled and disabled.

You'll find more information in the "[[file:getting_started.org::*Disabling%20packages][Disabling packages]]" section of the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting
Started]] guide.

** How do I reconfigure a package included in Doom?
~use-package!~ and ~after!~ (wrappers around ~use-package~ and
~eval-after-load~, respectively) are your bread and butter for configuring
packages in Doom.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Takes a feature symbol or a library name (string)
(after! evil
  (setq evil-magic nil))

;; Takes a major-mode, a quoted hook function or a list of either
(add-hook! python-mode
  (setq python-shell-interpreter "bpython"))

(use-package! hl-todo
  ;; if you omit :defer, :hook, :commands, or :after, then the package is loaded
  ;; immediately. By using :hook here, the `hl-todo` package won't be loaded
  ;; until prog-mode-hook is triggered (by activating a major mode derived from
  ;; it, e.g. python-mode)
  :hook (prog-mode . hl-todo-mode)
  :init
  ;; code here will run immediately
  :config
  ;; code here will run after the package is loaded
  (setq hl-todo-highlight-punctuation ":"))

;; There's also `setq-hook!' for setting variables buffer-locally
(setq-hook! python-mode python-indent-offset 2)
#+END_SRC

See the "[[file:getting_started.org::*Configuring%20Doom][Configuring Doom]]" section of the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting Started]] guide for more
explanation and examples.

** How do I change the theme?
There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
available. You can either set ~doom-theme~ or manually load a theme with the
~load-theme~ function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq doom-theme 'doom-tomorrow-night)
;; or
(load-theme 'doom-tomorrow-night t)
#+END_SRC

#+begin_quote
At the moment, the only difference between the two is that ~doom-theme~ is
loaded when Emacs has finished initializing at startup and ~load-theme~ loads
the theme immediately. Which you choose depends on your needs, but I recommend
setting ~doom-theme~ because, if I later discover a better way to load themes, I
can easily change how Doom uses ~doom-theme~, but I can't (easily) control how
you use the ~load-theme~ function.
#+end_quote

*** Installing a third party theme
To install a theme from a third party plugin, say, [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][solarized]], you need only
install it, then load it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/packages.el
(package! solarized)

;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq doom-theme 'solarized-dark)
#+END_SRC

Don't forget to run ~doom refresh~ after adding that ~package!~ statement to
ensure the package is installed.

** How do I change the fonts?
Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom, they are:

+ ~doom-font~
+ ~doom-variable-pitch-font~
+ ~doom-serif-font~
+ ~doom-unicode-font~
+ ~doom-big-font~ (used for ~doom-big-font-mode~)

Each of these will accept either a =font-spec=, font string (="Input Mono-12"=),
or [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_Logical_Font_Description][xlfd font string]].

e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; Add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Input Mono Narrow" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans") ; inherits `doom-font''s :size
      doom-unicode-font (font-spec :family "Input Mono Narrow" :size 12)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Fira Mono" :size 19))
#+END_SRC

** How do I bind my own keys (or change existing ones)?
The ~map!~ macro is recommended; it is a convenience macro that wraps around
Emacs' (and evil's) keybinding API, i.e. ~define-key~, ~global-set-key~,
~local-set-key~ and ~evil-define-key~.

You'll find comprehensive examples of ~map!~'s usage in its documentation (via
=SPC h f map!= or =C-h f map!= -- also found [[file:api.org][in docs/api]]).

You'll find a more comprehensive example of ~map!~'s usage in
[[file:../modules/config/default/+evil-bindings.el][config/default/+evil-bindings.el]].

** How do I get motions to treat underscores as word delimiters?
(This explanation comes from [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil#underscore-_-is-not-a-word-character][emacs-evil/evil]]'s readme)

An underscore "_" is a word character in Vim. This means that word-motions like
=w= skip over underlines in a sequence of letters as if it was a letter itself.
In contrast, in Evil the underscore is often a non-word character like
operators, e.g. =+=.

The reason is that Evil uses Emacs' definition of a word and this definition
does not often include the underscore. Word characters in Emacs are determined
by the syntax-class of the buffer. The syntax-class usually depends on the
major-mode of this buffer. This has the advantage that the definition of a
"word" may be adapted to the particular type of document being edited. Evil uses
Emacs' definition and does not simply use Vim's definition in order to be
consistent with other Emacs functions. For example, word characters are exactly
those characters that are matched by the regular expression character class
~[:word:]~.

If you want the underscore to be recognized as word character, you can modify
its entry in the syntax-table:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w")
#+END_SRC

This gives the underscore the word syntax-class. You can use a mode-hook to
modify the syntax-table in all buffers of some mode, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; For python
(add-hook! 'python-mode-hook (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w"))
;; For ruby
(add-hook! 'enh-ruby-mode-hook (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w"))
;; For Javascript
(add-hook! 'js2-mode-hook (modify-syntax-entry ?_ "w"))
#+END_SRC

** How do I change the leader/localleader keys?
These variables control what key to use for leader and localleader keys:

+ For Evil users:
  + ~doom-leader-key~ (default: =SPC=)
  + ~doom-localleader-key~ (default: =SPC m=)
+ For Emacs and Insert state (evil users), and non-evil users:
  + ~doom-leader-alt-key~ (default: =M-SPC= for evil users, =C-c= otherwise)
  + ~doom-localleader-alt-key~ (default: =M-SPC m= for evil users, =C-c l=
    otherwise)

e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq doom-leader-key ","
      doom-localleader-key "\\")
#+END_SRC

** How do I change the style of line-numbers (or disable them altogether)?
Doom uses the ~display-line-numbers~ package, which is built into Emacs 26+.

*** Disabling line numbers entirely
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq display-line-numbers-type nil)
;; or
(remove-hook! '(prog-mode-hook text-mode-hook conf-mode-hook)
              #'display-line-numbers-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** Switching to relative line numbers (permanently)
To change the style of line numbers, change the value of the
~display-line-numbers-type~ variable. It accepts the following values:

#+begin_example
t            normal line numbers
'relative    relative line numbers
'visual      relative line numbers in screen space
nil          no line numbers
#+end_example

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+END_SRC

You'll find more precise documentation on the variable through =<help> v
display-line-numbers-type= (=<help>= is =SPC h= for evil users, =C-h=
otherwise).

*** Switching the style of line numbers (temporarily)
Use ~M-x doom/toggle-line-numbers~ (bound to =SPC t l= by default) to cycle
through the available line number styles in the current buffer.

e.g. =normal -> relative -> visual -> disabled -> normal=.

** How do I change the behavior and appearance of popup windows?
The =:ui popup= module tries to standardize how Emacs handles "temporary"
windows. It includes a set of default rules that tell Emacs where to open them
(and how big they should be).

Check out the [[file:../modules/ui/popup/README.org::Configuration][:ui popup module's documentation]] for more on defining your own
rules.

You'll find more comprehensive documentation on ~set-popup-rule!~ in its
docstring (available through =SPC h f= -- or =C-h f= for non-evil users).

** Can Doom be customized without restarting Emacs?
Short answer: You can, but you shouldn't.

Long answer: Restarting Emacs is always your safest bet, but Doom provides a few
tools for experienced Emacs users to skirt around it (most of the time):

- Evaluate your changes on-the-fly with ~+eval/region~ (bound to the =gr=
  operator for evil users) or ~eval-last-sexp~ (bound to =C-x C-e=). Changes
  take effect immediately.
- On-the-fly evaluation won't work for all changes. e.g. Changing your ~doom!~
  block (i.e. the list of modules for Doom to enable).

  But rather than running ~doom refresh~ and restarting Emacs, Doom provides
  ~M-x doom/reload~ for your convenience (bound to =SPC h r r= and =C-h r r=).
  This runs ~doom refresh~, restarts the Doom initialization process and
  re-evaluates your personal config. However, this won't clear pre-existing
  state; Doom won't unload modules/packages that have already been loaded and it
  can't anticipate complications arising from a private config that isn't
  idempotent.
- Many ~bin/doom~ commands are available as elisp commands with the ~doom//*~
  prefix. e.g. ~doom//refresh~, ~doom//update~, etc. Feel free to use them, but
  consider them highly experimental and subject to change without notice.
- You can quickly restart Emacs and restore the last session with
  ~doom/restart-and-restore~ (bound to =SPC q r=).

** Can Vim/Evil be removed for a more vanilla Emacs experience?
Yes! See the [[file:../modules/editor/evil/README.org::Removing%20evil-mode][Removing evil-mode]] section in [[file:../modules/editor/evil/README.org][:editor evil]]'s documentation.

** Should I use ~make~ or ~bin/doom~?
~bin/doom~ is recommended. Doom's Makefile (to manage your config, at least) is
deprecated. It forwards to ~bin/doom~ anyway.

** When should and shouldn't I use ~bin/doom~?
~bin/doom~ is your best friend. It'll keep all your secrets (mostly because it's
a shell script incapable of sentience and thus incapable of retaining, much less
divulging, your secrets to others).

You can run ~bin/doom help~ to see what it's capable of, but here are some
commands that you may find particularly useful:

+ ~doom doctor~ :: Diagnose common issues in your environment and list missing
  external dependencies for your enabled modules.
+ ~doom refresh~ :: Ensures that all missing packages are installed, orphaned
  packages are removed, and metadata properly generated.
+ ~doom install~ :: Install any missing packages.
+ ~doom update~ :: Update all packages that Doom's (enabled) modules use.
+ ~doom env~ :: Regenerates your envvar file, which contains a snapshot of your
  shell environment for Doom Emacs to load on startup. You need to run this for
  changes to your shell environment to take effect.
+ ~doom purge -g~ :: Purge orphaned packages (i.e. ones that aren't needed
  anymore) and regraft your repos.
+ ~doom upgrade~ :: Upgrade Doom to the latest version (then update your
  packages). This is equivalent to:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git pull
  doom refresh
  doom update
  #+END_SRC

** When to run ~doom refresh~
As a rule of thumb you should run ~doom refresh~ whenever you:

+ Update Doom with ~git pull~ instead of ~doom upgrade~,
+ Change your ~doom!~ block in =$DOOMDIR/init.el=,
+ Change autoload files in any module (or =$DOOMDIR=),
+ Or change the packages.el file in any module (or =$DOOMDIR=).
+ Install an Emacs package or dependency outside of Emacs (i.e. through your OS
  package manager).

If anything is misbehaving, it's a good idea to run ~doom refresh~ first. ~doom
refresh~ is responsible for regenerating your autoloads file (which tells Doom
where to find lazy-loaded functions and libraries), installing missing packages,
and uninstall orphaned (unneeded) packages.

** How to suppress confirmation prompts while ~bin/doom~ is running
The ~-y~ and ~--yes~ flags (or the ~YES~ environment variable) will force
~bin/doom~ to auto-accept confirmation prompts:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
doom -y update
doom --yes update
YES=1 doom update
#+END_SRC

* Defaults
** Why Ivy over Helm?
Short answer: I chose ivy because it is the simpler of the two.

Long answer: Features and performance appear to be the main talking points when
comparing the two, but as far as I'm concerned they are equal in both respects
(not all across the board, but on average).

Instead, what is important to me is maintainability. As someone who frequently
extends and debugs his editor (and maintains a community config), I frequently
run up against issues with ivy and helm, but spend disproportionally more time
doing so with helm than I do ivy, for little or no gain. Though both frameworks
are excellent, the difference in complexity is also reflected in their plugin
ecosystems; ivy plugins tend to be lighter, simpler, more consistent and
significantly easier to hack if I want to change something. Unless you like helm
/just/ the way it is out of the box, ivy is just the simpler choice.

And since I dogfood it, Ivy's integration into Doom will always be a step or
three ahead of helm's.

** Why are there no default keybinds for Smartparens (for evil users)?
Doom only uses smartparens to manage pair "completion" (it does the job better
than electric-{pair,quote}-mode or the multitude of other pair-management
solutions in the Emacs ecosystem at the time of writing).

None of smartparen's commands have default keybinds for evil users because they
are redundant with motions and text-objects provided by evil/vim. If you
disagree, I recommend trying the =:editor lispy= or =:editor parinfer= modules.

** Why do non-evil users get expand-region, but not evil users?
~expand-region~ is redundant with and less precise than evil's text objects and
motions.

- There's a text object for every "step" of expansion that expand-region
  provides (and more). To select the word at point = =viw=, symbol at point =
  =vio=, line at point = =V=, the block at point (by indentation) = =vii=, the
  block at point (by braces) = =vib=, sentence at point = =vis=, paragraph =
  =vip=, and so on.
- Selection expansion can be emulated by using text objects consecutively: =viw=
  to select a word, followed by =io= to expand to a symbol, then =ib= expands to
  the surrounding brackets/parentheses, etc. There is no reverse of this
  however; you'd have to restart visual state.

The expand-region way dictates you start at some point and expand/contract until
you have what you want selected. The vim/evil way would rather you select
exactly what you want from the get go. In the rare event a text object fails
you, a combination of =o= (swaps your cursor between the two ends of the region)
and motion keys can adjust the ends of your selection.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are also text objects for xml tags (=x=), C-style function arguments
(=a=), angle brackets, and single/double quotes.
#+END_QUOTE

This is certainly more to remember compared to a pair of expand and contract
commands, but text objects (and motions) are the bread and butter of vim's modal
editing paradigm. Vimmers will feel right at home. To everyone else: mastering
them will have a far-reaching effect on your productivity. I highly recommend
putting in the time to learn them.

Otherwise, it is trivial to install expand-region and binds keys to it yourself:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/packages.el
(package! expand-region)

;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(map! :nv "C-=" #'er/contract-region
      :nv "C-+" #'er/expand-region)
#+END_SRC

** Why not use exec-path-from-shell instead of ~doom env~?
In a nutshell, the ~doom env~ approach is a faster and more robust solution.

1. ~exec-path-from-shell~ must spawn (at least) one process at startup to scrape
   your shell environment. This can be arbitrarily slow depending on the user's
   shell configuration. A single program (like pyenv or nvm) or config framework
   (like oh-my-zsh) could undo all of Doom's startup optimizations in one fell
   swoop.

2. ~exec-path-from-shell~ only scrapes /some/ state from your shell. You have to
   be proactive in order to get it to capture all the envvars relevant to your
   development environment.

   I'd rather it inherit your shell environment /correctly/ (and /completely/)
   or not at all. It frontloads the debugging process rather than hiding it
   until it you least want to deal with it.

That said, if you still want ~exec-path-from-shell~, it is trivial to install
yourself:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; add to ~/.doom.d/packages.el
(package! exec-path-from-shell)

;;; add to ~/.doom.d/config.el
(require 'exec-path-from-shell)
(when (display-graphic-p)
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+END_SRC
** Why wsbutler over delete-trailing-whitespace or whitespace-cleanup?
TL;DR: =ws-butler= is less imposing.

Don't be that guy who PRs 99 whitespace adjustments around his one-line
contribution. Don't automate this aggressive behavior by attaching
~delete-trailing-whitespace~ (or ~whitespace-cleanup~) to ~before-save-hook~. If
you have rambunctious colleagues peppering trailing whitespace into your project,
you need to have a talk (with wiffle bats, preferably) rather than play this
passive-aggressive game of whack-a-mole.

Here at Doom Inc we believe that operations that mutate entire files should
never be automated. Rather, they should be invoked deliberately -- by someone
that is aware of the potential consequences. This is where =ws-butler= comes in.
It only cleans up whitespace /on the lines you've touched/ *and* it leaves
behind virtual whitespace (which is never written to the file, but remains there
so your cursor doesn't get thrown around in all that cleanup work).

In any case, if you had used =ws-butler= from the beginning, trailing whitespace
and newlines would never be a problem!

* Common Issues
** I get the vanilla Emacs splash screen at startup
The most common cause for this is a =~/.emacs= file. If it exists, Emacs will
read this file instead of the =~/.emacs.d= directory, ignoring Doom altogether.

If this isn't the case, try running ~bin/doom doctor~. It can detect a variety
of common issues and may give you some clues as to what is wrong.

** I see a blank scratch buffer at startup
This commonly means that Emacs can't find your private doom config (in
=~/.doom.d= or =~/.config/doom=). Make sure *only one of these two* folders
exist, and that it has an init.el file with a ~doom!~ block. Running ~doom
install~ will populate your private doom directory with the bare minimum you
need to get going.

If nothing else works, try running ~bin/doom doctor~. It can detect a variety of
common issues and may give you some clues as to what is wrong.

** Strange (or incorrect) icons are displayed everywhere
Many of Doom's UI modules use the =all-the-icons= plugin, which uses special
fonts to display icons. These fonts must be installed for them to work properly,
otherwise you'll get a bunch of squares and mismatched icons. When running ~doom
install~, you will be asked whether you want these installed for you or not.

If you did not accept or need to reinstall those fonts, MacOS and Linux users
can install them with ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~. Windows users will need
to use this command to download the fonts somewhere, then they must install them
manually (e.g. by double-clicking each file in explorer).

** ~void-variable~ and ~void-function~ errors on startup
The most common culprit for these types of errors are:

1. An out-of-date autoloads file. To regenerate it, run ~doom refresh~.

   To avoid this issue, remember to run ~doom refresh~ whenever you modify your
   ~doom!~ block in =~/.doom.d/init.el=, or add ~package!~ declarations to
   =~/.doom.d/packages.el=. Or if you modify =~/.emacs.d/.local= by hand, for
   whatever reason.

   See ~doom help refresh~ for details on what this command does and when you
   should use it.

2. Emacs byte-code isn't forward compatible. If you've recently switched to a
   newer (or older) version of Emacs, you'll need to either reinstall or
   recompile your installed plugins. This can be done by:

   + Running ~doom build~,
   + Or deleting =~/.emacs.d/.local/straight= then running ~doom install~ (this
     will take a while).

** Doom can't find my executables/doesn't inherit the correct ~PATH~
The two most common causes for PATH issues in Doom are:

1. Your shell configuration doesn't configure ~PATH~ correctly. If ~which
   <PROGRAM>~ doesn't emit the path you expect on the command line then this is
   likely the case.

2. Your app launcher (rofi, albert, docky, dmenu, sxhkd, etc) is launching Emacs
   with the wrong shell, either because it defaults to a different shell from
   the one you use or the app launcher itself inherits the wrong environment
   because /it/ was launched from the wrong shell.

3. You're a Mac user launching Emacs from an Emacs.app bundle. MacOS launches
   these apps from an isolated environment.

As long as your shell is properly configured, there is a simple solution to
issues #1 and #3: generate an envvar file by running ~doom env~. This scrapes
your shell environment into a file that is loaded when Doom Emacs starts up.
Check out ~doom help env~ for details on how this works.

For issue #2, you'll need to investigate your launcher. [[https://discord.gg/bcZ6P3y][Our Discord]] is a good
place to ask about it.

** There's artefacting on my icon fonts in GUI Emacs ([[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/956][#956]])
Check your font rendering settings. Changing the RGBA order to "rgba" will often
fix this issue. See [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/956][#956]] for details.

** The =s= and =S= keys don't behave like they do in vim/evil ([[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/1307][#1307]])
This is intentional. =s= and =S= have been replaced by the evil-snipe plugin,
which provides 2-character versions of the f/F motion keys, ala vim-seek or
vim-sneak.

These keys were changed because they are redundant with =cl= and =cc=
respectively (and the new behavior was deemed more useful).

If you still want to restore the old behavior, simply disable evil-snipe-mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; in ~/.doom.d/config.el
(after! evil-snipe
  (evil-snipe-mode -1))
#+END_SRC

** Changes to my config aren't taking effect
1. Make sure you don't have both =~/.doom.d= and =~/.config/doom= directories.
   Doom will ignore the former if the latter exists.

2. Remember to run ~doom refresh~ when it is necessary. To get to know when,
   exactly, you should run this command, run ~doom help refresh~.

If neither of these solve your issue, try ~bin/doom doctor~. It will detect a
variety of common issues, and may give you some clues as to what is wrong.

** The frame goes black on MacOS, while in full-screen mode
There are known issues with childframes and macOS's fullscreen mode. There is no
known fix for this. To work around it, you must either:

1. Avoid MacOS native fullscreen by maximizing Emacs instead,

2. Disable childframes (controlled by the =+childframe= flag on the modules that
   support it),

3. Install Emacs via the =emacs-mac= homebrew formula.
** Doom crashes when...
Here are a few common causes for random crashes:

+ You have enabled ~undo-tree-auto-save-history~. A bloated cache for a
  particular file can cause a stack overflow. These caches are stored in
  =~/.emacs.d/.local/cache/undo-tree-hist/=. Delete this folder to clear it.
+ On some systems (particularly MacOS), manipulating the fringes or window
  margins can cause Emacs to crash. This is most prominent in the Doom Dashboard
  (which tries to center its contents), in org-mode buffers (which uses
  ~org-indent-mode~ to create virtual indentation), or magit. There is currently
  no known fix for this, as it can't be reliably reproduced. Your best bet is to
  reinstall/rebuild Emacs or disable the errant plugins/modules. e.g.

  To disable org-indent-mode:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (after! org
    (setq org-startup-indented nil))
  #+END_SRC

  Or disable the =:ui doom-dashboard= & =:tools magit= modules (see [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/1170][#1170]]).

** Can't load my theme; ~unable to find theme file for X~ errors
This means Emacs can't find the X-theme.el file for the theme you want to load.
Emacs will search for this file in ~custom-theme-load-path~ and
~custom-theme-directory~. There are a couple reasons why it can't be found:

1. It is generally expected that third party themes will [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/blob/master/doom-themes.el#L400-L405][add themselves]] to
   ~custom-theme-load-path~, but you will occasionally encounter a theme that
   does not. This should be reported upstream.

   In the meantime, you can get around this by eagerly loading the package:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (require 'third-party-theme)
   (setq doom-theme 'third-party)
   #+END_SRC
2. You've appended ~-theme~ to the end of your theme's name.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (setq doom-theme 'third-party-theme)
   #+END_SRC

   When you load a theme Emacs searches for ~X-theme.el~. If you set
   ~doom-theme~ to ~'third-party-theme~, it will search for
   ~third-party-theme-theme.el~. This is rarely intentional. Omit the ~-theme~
   suffix.
3. Did you run ~doom refresh~ after adding your third party theme plugin's
   ~package!~ declaration to =~/.doom.d/packages.el=?
