#+TITLE: Doom Emacs Documentation
#+STARTUP: nofold

Doom is a configuration framework for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs 26.3+]] tailored for Emacs
bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks and the
performance of a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your
own config or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite
OS.

Doom is an opinionated collection of reasonable (and optional) defaults with a
focus on performance (both runtime and startup) and on abstraction-light,
readable code design, so that there is less between you and Emacs.

#+begin_quote
The documentation is designed to be viewed within Doom Emacs. Access it by
pressing =SPC d h= (or =C-h d h= for non-evil users), or search it with =SPC h d
s= (or =C-h d s=).
