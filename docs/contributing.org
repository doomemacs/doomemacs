Doom Emacs is an active and ongoing project, maintained mostly by a single
person, but includes the efforts of 200 contributors and growing. There is no
shortage of things that need doing; bugs that need stomping, features that need
implementing, and documentation that needs documenting. If Doom's been useful to
you, convert some caffiene into code; it'd be a huge help!

You are welcome to [[https://discord.gg/qvGgnVx][join us on our Discord server]], otherwise read on to learn how
to contribute to our fine corner of the interwebs.

* Where can I help?
+ Our [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues][issue tracker]] has many issues. If you find one that you have an answer to,
  it would be a huge help!
+ Look for issues tagged [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/labels/good%20first%20issue][good first issue]]. These were judged to have a low
  barrier of entry.
+ Look for issues tagged [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/labels/help%20wanted][help wanted]]. These tend to be a little (or a lot)
  harder, and are issues outside my own expertise.
+ If you've encountered a bug, [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/new/choose][file a bug report]].
+ The [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/projects/3][development roadmap board]] is a rough timeline of what is being worked on
  and when. It will give you an idea of what will change and where you can
  redirect your efforts.
+ The [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/projects/2][plugins under review board]] lists third party plugins being considered (or
  rejected) for inclusion in Doom Emacs. Approved and unclaimed packages are
  open for you to implement yourself.
+ The [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/projects/5][upstream bugs board]] lists known issues that have external causes, but
  affect Doom. If you're feeling adventurous (or are better acquainted with the
  cause) perhaps you can address them at the source.

* TODO Reporting issues
You've found a problem and you're ready to fire off that bug report. Hold up!
Before you do that, [[file:getting_started.org::*Troubleshoot][have a look at our Troubleshooting guide]]. If none of these
suggestions pan out, /then/ it is time to file a bug report.

An effective bug report is informative. Please try to provide:

+ A backtrace of all mentioned errors.
+ A step-by-step reproduction of the issue.
+ Information about your Doom config and system environment.
+ Screenshots/casts of the issue (if possible).

This section will show you how to collect this information.

** Acquire a backtrace from errors
See "[[file:getting_started.org::*How to extract a backtrace from an error][How to extract a backtrace from an error]]" in the [[file:getting_started.org][Getting Started]] guide.

** TODO Create a step-by-step reproduction guide

** TODO Include information about your Doom install

** TODO Debugging crashes with gdb

* TODO Suggesting features, keybinds and/or enhancements

* TODO Contributing code
There's much to be done around here! We need bugfixes, new features, and
documentation. If you'd like to convert some caffeine into Emacs Lisp, here are
a few considerations before starting that PR:

** TODO Conventions
*** TODO Code style
Doom conforms to [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][@bbatsov's emacs-lisp style guide]] with the following
exceptions:

+ Use ~mapc~ instead of ~seq-do~.
+ No hanging parentheses
+ We use =DEPRECATED= to indicate code that will eventually be removed.

*** Naming conventions
Doom has a number of naming conventions that it uses in addition to the standard
lisp conventions. Third party packages may use their own conventions as well.

**** Lisp Naming Conventions
The lisp conventions are simple. Symbols follow ~NAMESPACE-SYMBOLNAME~ for
public variables/functions (e.g. ~bookmark-default-file~ or
~electric-indent-mode~) and ~NAMESPACE--SYMBOLNAME~ for private ones (e.g.
~byte-compile--lexical-environment~ and ~yas--tables~).

~NAMESPACE~ is usually the name of the containing file or package. E.g. the
~company~ plugin prefixes all its variables/functions with ~company-~.

**** Doom Naming Conventions
+ ~doom/NAME~ or ~+MODULE/NAME~ :: Denotes a public command designed to be used
  interactively, via =M-x= or a keybinding. e.g. ~doom/info~, ~+popup/other~,
  ~+ivy/rg~.
+ ~doom:NAME~ :: A public evil operator, motion or command. e.g. ~+evil:align~,
  ~+ivy:rg~.
+ ~doom-[-]NAME-h~ or ~+MODULE-[-]NAME-h~ :: A non-interactive function meant to
  be used (exclusively) as a hook. e.g. ~+cc-fontify-constants-h~,
  ~+flycheck-buffer-h~.
+ ~doom-[-]NAME-a~ or ~+MODULE-[-]NAME-a~ :: Functions designed to be used as
  advice for other functions. e.g. ~doom-set-jump-a~,
  ~doom--fix-broken-smie-modes-a~, ~+org--babel-lazy-load-library-a~
+ ~doom-[-]NAME-fn~ or ~+MODULE-[-]NAME-fn~ :: Indicates an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern][strategy]] function. A
  good rule of thumb for what makes a strategy function is: is it
  interchangeable? Can it be replaced with another function with a matching
  signature? e.g. ~+lookup-dumb-jump-backend-fn~, ~+magit-display-buffer-fn~,
  ~+workspaces-set-project-action-fn~
+ ~abc!~ :: A public Doom "autodef" function or macro. An autodef should always
  be defined, even if its containing module is disabled (i.e. they will not
  throw a void-function error). The purpose of this is to avoid peppering module
  configs with conditionals or `after!` blocks before using their APIs. They
  should noop if their module is disabled, and should be zero-cost in the case
  their module is disabled.

  Autodefs usually serve to configure Doom or a module. e.g. ~after!~,
  ~set-company-backends!~, ~set-evil-initial-state!~

*** TODO Commits & PRs
+ Target =develop= instead of =master=. The only exception are hotfixes!

*** TODO Keybind conventions

** TODO Your first code contribution

** TODO Submitting pull requests

** TODO Contributing to Doom core

** TODO Contributing to an existing module

** TODO Contributing a new module

* TODO Contributing documentation
Doom Emacs' documentation is an ongoing effort. If you have suggestions,
improvements, tutorials and/or articles to submit, don't hesitate to get in
contact via our [[https://discord.gg/bcZ6P3y][Discord server]] or [[mailto:henrik@lissner.net][email]]. I appreciate any help I can get!

** TODO Contributing to Doom's manual

** TODO Contributing module documentation

* TODO Help keep packages up-to-date!
Doom pins all its packages to reduce the likelihood of upstream breakage leaking
into Doom Emacs. However, we may miss when a package releases hotfixes for
critical issues. Let us know or PR a bump to our pinned packages.

* TODO Special thanks
