  + =core= [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]], a better help buffer; possible replacement for ~describe-function~.
+ *Planned modules:*
  + =app/finance= -- ledger + org-mode.
  + =app/crm= -- Customer Relations Management, in Emacs, using org-mode.
  + =app/write= -- Make Emacs into a focused plaintext word processor (using markdown, org and rst) for writing papers and stories.
  + =app/regex= -- PCRE IDE, with live buffer matching, search/replace support, and an export-to-code feature for various languages.
    + +Perl backend+
    + Search and replace support
    + Highlight replaced segments
    + Export-to-code feature for:
      + python (use ~re~ or ~regex~)
      + php (~preg_(match(_all)?|replace)~)
      + ruby (~%r[.+]~)
      + javascript (node) (~/.+/.test(...)~)
      + C (~regex.h~ + ~regcomp~)

  + =lang/alda= -- Language support for [[https://github.com/alda-lang/alda][Alda]], the music programming language, using [[https://github.com/jgkamat/alda-mode][alda-mode]].
+ *Bug fixes:*
  + =core-ui= Replace or fix ~winner-mode~ unreliability (will close windows trying to revive killed buffers). Perhaps make ~doom/kill-this-buffer~ only disassociate buffer from persp-mode or bury buffer if persp-mode is inactive.
  + =ui/doom-modeline= Fix ~0/0~ leftover panel in modeline (caused by lingering anzu state).
+ =lang/org=
  + Drag-drop image attachment (~org-download~) and central storage
  + Unified export system
  + Better shackle + org-agenda integration
  + Fix janky visual line motions (~evil-next-visual-line~, etc)
  + Fix janky cursor positioning when jumping between org-table cells from insert mode.
  + Certain characters/keys--when typed in a table--cause the cell to shrink (likely cause: custom self-insert-char behavior -- like smartparens pairs & custom SPC/BKSPC binds)
+ =feature/jump= Automatic etags generation (for dwim go-to-definition and, perhaps, code-completion for some languages; lua maybe?).
+ =lang/php= Automatic and async tags generation using [[https://github.com/xcwen/phpctags][phpctags]].
+ =lang/lua= True, dynamic code-completion? Looks like [[https://github.com/immerrr/lua-mode/pull/119][this PR in lua-mode]] may have the answer. Does it make ~company-lua~ redundant?
+ Make QUELPA outdated-detection async with ~async-start~ and ~async-get~ (in ~doom/packages-update~).
+ =tools/upload= Add ~+upload/open-remote-file~ command to open current file on the remote (with TRAMP).
+ Add =bin/org-alert= script -- a cron script that scans TODOs in org files and dispatches system alerts.
+ =feature/workspaces= Add a bookmarks feature, but for wconfs, that can revive file buffers. Also needs an interface.
+ Add README.org's with working babel blocks to modules.
+ =ui/doom-modeline= fix hardcoded spacing in between segments.

* Unreleased (master)
+ *New modules:*
  + =tools/password-store= -- Emacs as a password manager, using [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] as a backend (contributed by [[https://github.com/bandresen][brandresen]]).
  + =app/irc= -- Emacs as an IRC client, using circe (contributed by [[https://github.com/bandresen][brandresen]]).
    + ~+pass/ivy~ for ivy integration, with edit/copy field/open url actions.
    + ~helm-pass~ for helm integration.
+ =core=
  + New variable: ~doom-host-dir~, as a base path for ~doom-etc-dir~ and ~doom-cache-dir~.
  + New hooks: ~doom-init-hook~ and ~doom-post-init-hook~, which are run on ~emacs-startup-hook~. This is meant to simplify post-Emacs initialization hooks (~after-init-hook~, ~emacs-startup-hook~ and ~window-setup-hook~) into two unambiguous ones.
  + =core-ui=
    + Add quit confirmation when trying to close a frame that contains real buffers.
    + Fix quit confirmations for clients connected to ~emacs --daemon~ with ~emacsclient~.

  + =core-packages=
    + Fix quelpa temporary files (in ~quelpa-build-dir~) not being removed when a quelpa package is uninstalled.
    + New hook: ~doom-reload-hook~ (sort of). This has been around for a while, but now it is defined and documented. It runs when ~doom/reload~ is called (which gets called remotely if you run package management while an Emacs session is active).
+ =feature=
  + =feature/evil=
    + Remove =goto-last-change=, which conflicts with =goto-chg=, which is a dependency of evil (that does the exact same thing, but is what evil uses).
+ =ui=
  + =ui/doom=
    + Vastly improve daemon and terminal support for doom-themes by reloading the theme when a new client is attached, or new terminal/daemon frame is created. This prevents incorrect colors from bleeding across face class barriers.
+ =lang=
  + =lang/org=
    + Fix M-RET in plain lists not preserving indent level for new items.
    + Fix cursor jumping away when toggling folds or realigning org tables (pressing TAB).

+ *New modules*
  + =ui/unicode= -- fixes unicode font-rendering for a variety of languages, using [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts][unicode-fonts]].
  + =ui/evil-goggles= -- visual feedback for edit operations in evil-mode, using [[https://github.com/edkolev/evil-goggles][evil-goggles]].
  + =ui/nav-flash= (extracted from =ui/doom=) -- flashes current line when moving cursor considerable distrances, using [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/nav-flash][nav-flash]].
  + =tools/neotree= (extracted from =feature/evil=) -- a file explorer sidebar, using [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree/][neotree]].

  + New help command: ~doom/describe-setting~ -- for possible ~set!~ targets.
  + Add =make doctor= to diagnose common issues with your setup & environment.
  + Removed ~def-bootstrap~ & ~doom-bootstrap~. It was a clumsy system. I'll replace it with README.org files in each module, with working, tangle-able source blocks.
  + =core-os=
    + Don't use GTK tooltips on Linux (ugly!).
  + =core-ui=
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/vi-tilde-fringe][vi-tilde-fringe]] -- subtle, vim-ish empty-line indicator.
    + New variable: ~doom-ui-mode-names~ (alist) -- for changing ~mode-name~ of major-modes.
    + Fix left-over hl-line overlays when hl-line-mode is uncleanly killed (e.g. when the major-mode is changed).
    + Fix disappearing line numbers in nlinum (thanks to [[https://github.com/gilbertw1][gilbertw1]]).
  + =core-keybinds=
    + New property for ~map!~: ~:textobj~ -- for binding to evil text objects keymaps.
    + Fix ~:after~ & ~:map*~ properties in ~map!~ macro (wasn't working at all).
    + Change keybinding scheme; the leader key is now =SPC= and localleader =SPC m=, inspired by spacemacs.
    + Enable which-key pops up for all keys.
  + =core-popups=
    + Properly persist ~popup~ window parameter between sessions.
    + Improve magit+shackle integration; ensures that links will be followed within the popup they were opened.
    + Add ~doom-popup-no-fringe~ option (default = t). When non-nil, fringes will be disabled in popup windows (in ~doom-popup-mode~).
  + =core-packages=
    + Fix failure to detect out-of-date QUELPA packages.
    + Fix ~custom-file~ (and custom settings) not being loaded.
    + Fix crash in ~doom-update-package~ caused by unreachable, new dependencies.
    + Make ~doom-update-package~ atomic in case of failure.
    + Make ~doom-refresh-packages~ async.
    + Improve the security of package management (via ELPA) by a) forcing Emacs to verify TLS connections and b) use HTTPS sources for MELPA and ELPA.
+ =feature=
  + =feature/evil=
    + Add ~+evil:mc~ command [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc][evil-mc]].
    + Add ~+evil/mc-make-cursor-here~, with visual-block support for [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc][evil-mc]].
    + =d= (operator) now invokes ~wgrep-mark-deletion~ in wgrep buffers.
    + New code folding system that combines hideshow (built-in; for indent/marker-based folds) and [[https://github.com/alexmurray/evil-vimish-fold][evil-vimish-fold]] (for arbitrary folds).
    + Fix [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-matchit][evil-matchit]] in visual mode.
    + Fix [[https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit][evil-multiedit]] M-d bindings.
    + Fix stringp error caused by unintialized state in hideshow.
    + Fix evil normal-mode keybindings in help-mode popups.
    + Change how ~+evil-esc-hook~ hooks are handled: they now short-circuit on the first hook to return non-nil.
    + Remove ~+evil/matchit~ (thin wrapper around ~evilmi-jump-items~).
    + Remove [[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree/][neotree]] plugin (moved to =tools/neotree=).
  + =feature/jump=
    + Call ~recenter~ after using [[https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump][dumb-jump]].

    + No longer saves session on quit if session was blank.
+ =completion=
  + =completion/ivy=
    + Flexible column width for ~+ivy/tasks~.
+ =ui=
  + =ui/doom=
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-solaire-mode][solaire-mode]] -- replaces ~doom-buffer-mode~; brightens source windows and dims transient, temporary, or popup windows.
  + =ui/doom-modeline=
    + Reduce excess whitespace on right of flycheck segment.

  + =tools/gist=
    + Changed new gists to be private by default.

    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/iquiw/company-ghc][company-ghc]] -- code-completion support for haskell (requires ~ghc-mod~).
  + =lang/php=
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/xcwen/ac-php][company-php]] -- code-completion support for php (requires a TAGs file created with [[https://github.com/xcwen/phpctags][phpctags]]).
  + =lang/emacs-lisp=
    + Omit defuns inside macros from the imenu index.
    + Don't enable ~flycheck-mode~ in emacs.d files.

* 2.0.2 (May 13, 2017)
+ *New modules*
  + =tools/gist= -- allows you to manage and create gists, using [[https://github.com/defunkt/gist.el][gist.el]].
  + =tools/term= -- quickly spawn a terminal (in a popup or buffer) using [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/multi-term][multi-term]]
  + =app/twitter= -- Emacs as a twitter client, using [[https://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode][twittering-mode]]
+ =core=
  + Stop "buffer is read-only" messages while in minibuffer, when I accidentally try to edit the prompt. It's correct behavior, but it consumes the minibuffers, hiding what I'm typing.
  + Fix Emacs daemon compatibility with DOOM, which assumed a frame will always be visible on startup, causing errors when Emacs is launched as a daemon.
  + Code-style change: use sharp-quote for functions. This makes the byte-compiler output missing-function warnings when they can't be found, which is helpful.
  + Stop projectile & git-gutter checks when in a TRAMP buffer; it causes tremendous slowdowns, to the point of being unusable.
  + Add ~message!~ & ~format!~ macros for printing colored output either a) in a popup buffer when in an interactive session or b) with ansi codes when in an noninteractive session.
  + Changed ~doom/recompile~ to aggresively recompile =core/core.el= to fix load-path inconsistencies when you've byte-compiled your config and run a package management command.
  + =core-lib=
    + Add ~:append~ support to ~add-transient-hook!~ macro.
  + =core-popups=
    + Fix over-eager ESC binding killing all popups indiscriminantly
  + =core-ui=
    + Remove references to ~ace-maximize-window~ (obsolete)
    + Fix whitespace adjustment in ~highlight-indentation-current-column-mode~
  + =core-packages=
    + Package management now produces colored and detailed feedback.
+ =ui=
  + =ui/doom=
    + Git-gutter fringe bitmaps no longer appear truncated.
    + Fix lack of syntax highlighting in scratch buffer
    + Use comment face as default color for ~+doom-folded-face~
  + =ui/doom-modeline=
    + Fix modeline disappearing due to loss of state. ~doom--modeline-format~ was being killed when switching major modes.
+ =feature=
  + =feature/eval=
    + Fix ~:repl~ & ~+eval/repl-send-region~.
    + Fix ~+eval/region~ failing only on first invocation because ~+eval-runners-alist~ wasn't populated until quickrun is loaded.
    + Add TAB auto-completion in comint-mode and REPL buffers
  + =feature/evil=
    + Fix ~:mv~ & ~:rm~.
    + Fix Neotree forgetting that it's a neotree window when switching perspectives.
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/gabesoft/evil-mc][evil-mc]] -- multiple cursors for evil-mode (thanks to [[https://github.com/gilbertw1][gilbertw1]])
    + Achieve vim parity w/ file modifiers (~+evil*ex-replace-special-filenames~)
  + =feature/version-control=
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine][git-timemachine]] -- stepping through a file's git history.
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/sshaw/git-link][git-link]] -- generates and opens links to "this file"'s remote repo with your default browser.
    + Add ~:gbrowse~: find this file on github/gitlab/bitbucket in your browser.
    + Add ~:gissues~: open this project's issues page in your browser.
    + Fix ~+vcs/git-browse~ and ~+vcs/git-browse-issues~.
  + =feature/workspaces=
    + Add BANG modifier to ~:cleanup~ to span all workspaces.
    + Since persp-mode handles its "nil" perspective differently from others, pretend that it doesn't exist and spawn a new "main" perspective.
+ =completion=
  + =completion/ivy=
    + Add ~+ivy-do-action!~ factory macro. Use it for in-ivy keybindings.
    + Add ripgrep file search support. Ripgrep doesn't support multiline searches, but is faster. Use =ag= for multiline (or more PCRE-compliant) searches.
    + Reverse ivy's built-in behavior of reversing escaping of parentheses when using the_silver_searcher or ripgrep. If you want literal parentheses, escape them explicitly.
    + Removed ~def-counsel-action!~
    + When a selection is used for ~:ag~, the selected text is now regexp-escaped.
+ =tools=
  + =tools/tmux=
    + Fix and refactor library (general update).
+ =lang=
  + =lang/cc=

    + Bind ~M-z~ (~undo~), ~C-u~ (~delete-line~) and ~C-w~ (~delete-word~) in ~org-store-link~ and ~org-insert-link~ prompts.
    + Apply org-headline-done face to checked-checkbox lines, to match how DONE headlines look. Also applies this to items whose subitems are all complete.
    + Changed default fold behavior when loading an org-file to unfold first level folds.
    + Add =bin/org-capture= shell script for invoking the org-capture frame from outside Emacs.
    + Add babel support for: rust, restclient, sql, google translate, haskell and go.
    + Add ~+org-pretty-mode~ for toggling "pretty" fontification. Prettified entities or hidden regions can make editing difficult.
  + =lang/python=
    + Add ipython detection and REPL support
    + Simplify matchit key (%) in python. The default is to prioritize if-else and other blocks over brackets. I found this frustrating.
  + =lang/web=
    + Fix ~+web-encode-entities~, ~+web-decode-entities~, ~+web/encode-entities-region~ and ~+web/decode-entities-region~.
+ =app=
  + =app/email=
    + Replace mbsync with offlineimap.
    + Add support for marking multiple emails when in visual-mode (evil) in a ~mu4e-headers-mode~ buffer.
    + Fix trash mark causing duplicates upstream.

  + Add keybinds for [[https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit][evil-multiedit]]: based around ~M-d~ and ~M-D~.
  + Replace ~:find~ with ~:ag~, ~:agc[wd]~, ~:rg~ and ~:rgc[wd]~.
  + Fix ~:x~ ex command (open scratch buffer)

* 2.0.1 (Apr 8, 2017)
+ *New modules*
  + =feature/jump= -- extra code navigation tools, a jump-to-definition implementation that just works ([[https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump][dumb-jump]]), and tools for looking things up online.
  + =app/rss= -- Emacs as an RSS reader, using [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]]
+ =core=
  + Fix ~doom-kill-process-buffers~ not killing process buffers.
  + Fix ~hippie-expand~ in ex mode/the minibuffer.
  + Remove unnecessary ~provide~'s in core autoloaded libraries.
  + Fix ~doom-buffers-in-mode~ not detecting buffers in major-modes derived from the target mode.
  + Fix out-of-bounds error in ~doom/backward-delete-whitespace-to-column~.
  + Remove ~doom/append-semicolon~; use evil append mode instead.
  + Add module bootstrapping mechanism (for installing external dependencies); see ~doom-bootstrap~, ~make bootstrap~ and ~def-bootstrap!~.
  + Use ~doom-local-dir~ for TRAMP's temp files.
  + New variable: ~doom-real-buffer-functions~ -- for customizing how ~doom-real-buffer-p~ determines what a "real" buffer is.
  + Add ~def-memoize!~ for defining memoized functions and ~doom-memoize~ for memoizing existing ones.
  + =core-lib=
    + Fix ~remove-hook!~ macro not expanding correctly.
    + New macro: ~add-transient-hook!~; attach a hook to a hook or function that will remove itself once it runs.
  + =core-packages=
    + Add ~doom/recompile~, for re-byte-compiling DOOM.
    + Add ~doom/compile-lite~ / ~make compile-lite~, which will only byte-compile DOOM's core files, which is a lighter alternative to ~doom/compile~.
    + Fix duplicates packages appearing in package-management retrieval library.
  + =core-os=
    + Reducing how aggressive ~exec-path~ caching is. A =persistent-soft= /and/ byte-compilation cache is excessive. The latter is good (and flexible) enough.
  + =core-popups=
    + Set default ~:align~ and ~:select~ shackle properties (of =8= and =below=).
  + =core-editor=
    + Advise ~delete-trailing-whitespace~ to not affect current line. If evil is loaded, then it may affect the current line if we're *not* in insert mode.
  + =core-projects=
    + Recognize =package.json= as a project-root file (see ~projectile-project-root-files~).
    + Fix ~:files~ property in ~def-project-mode!~ not detecting project files.
  + =core-ui=
    + Replace [[https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides][highlight-indent-guides-mode]] with [[https://github.com/antonj/Highlight-Indentation-for-Emacs/][highlight-indentation-mode]]; the former won't display indent guides on blank lines, even with my whitespace injection hook.
+ =feature=
  + =feature/eval=
    + Fix build tasks system; now tested and works.
    + Complete rewrite of the module.
  + =feature/evil=
    + Fix error in ~+evil:file-move~ if ~save-place-mode~ is disabled.
  + =feature/snippets=
    + Don't hijack TAB in other modes.
    + Enable ~yas-triggers-in-field~, which adds support for nested snippets.
    + Fix snippet aliases (~%alias~).
  + =feature/version-control=
    + Remove ~evil-magit~ and evil-ified bindings for magit in general. Instead, just use emacs mode. If evil is needed, toggle it with =C-z=.
  + =feature/workspaces=
    + Fix ~+workspace/kill-session~ not actually killing the session.
    + Revert forcing persp-mode to stay quiet when it saves the session to file. It just isn't important enough.
    + Create a new perspective when switching projects (integrates projectile with persp-mode).
    + Create a new perspective for new frames.
+ =ui=
  + =ui/doom=
    + Improve ~doom-buffer-mode~ heuristics with ~doom-real-buffer-p~, so that only truly real buffers are enlightened.
    + Replace plugin [[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][beacon]] with [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/nav-flash][nav-flash]] -- the former had a habit of causing pauses and pushing my cursor. It also didn't look as nice.
  + =ui/doom-modeline=
    + Complete rewrite of the module for code readability and performance.
  + =ui/doom-dashboard=
    + Fix a ~max-specpdl-size~ error caused on MacOS, having to do with a ~kill-buffer-query-function~ hook being attached way too soon in the startup process.
+ =lang=
  + =lang/cc=
    + Fix empty ~buffer-file-name~ in ~magic-mode-alist~ rule for obj-c.

  + =lang/go=
    + Add code-completion support with [[https://github.com/nsf/gocode][gocode and company-go]].
    + Add code navigation support with [[https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el/blob/master/go-guru.el][go-guru]] (built-in to go-mode).
    + Add REPL support with [[https://github.com/manute/gorepl-mode][gore and gorepl-mode]].
  + =lang/haskell=
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/jyp/dante][dante]] -- offers xref and flycheck integration, as well as code-navigation tools, like finding definitions, references, type info, etc.
    + Fix errors on haskell-mode (caused by missing dependencies).

    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/yasuyk/web-beautify][web-beautify]] -- js reformatting.
    + New plugin: [[https://github.com/NicolasPetton/xref-js2][xref-js2]] -- xref integration for javascript.
